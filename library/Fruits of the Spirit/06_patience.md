## Practicing Patience

We know that patience is an attribute of God, and we know from Galatians 5:22-23 that it's something that the Holy Spirit is working within you to grow and increase, in order to make you more like Christ. So let's quickly review our command to patience, which the Spirit will enable us to obey, and then we'll look at what a patient Christian looks like.

### Our Command to Patience

Both the Old and New Testaments contain commands to be patient, so let's take a look at a few.

#### Old Testament

>**Psalm 37:7-9** Rest in the Lord, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth.

Here we see that patience should be an attribute we display, and one that keeps us from worrying about the wicked prospering and benefiting from God’s general patience. We’re also told - as patient people - to get away from anger and worry because we are waiting on the Lord with the knowledge that one day we will inherit the earth as he’s promised.

>**Ecclesiastes 7:8-9** Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.

Here we’re reminded to “see it through” and we see an interesting comparison. God doesn’t contrast a patient person with a worrying person or even an anxious person, but with an angry, proud person. He goes further to say that someone who is angry and proud is a fool.

I find it interesting that Psalm 37 also contrasts patience with anger, and I think that’s something for us to seek to apply. When we go back to look at peace, I think that we’ll find it’s less contrasted with anger than patience.

#### New Testament

>**Romans 15:5-6** Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Paul explicitly tells us that God’s patience should translate into us living patiently. Here though, the application is that we will all be able to be “likeminded” toward each other, which will allow us to worship together. Clearly Paul realized that patient living would be necessary for the church to function as it should.

>**Colossians 3:12** Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;

Galatians 5 says that patience will grow out of us as a fruit of the spirit, but just as with the other fruits we see that it’s paired with a command as well. Because those who are saved are the elect of God, they must put on patience along with other virtues.

### What do patient teens look like?

So really what we need to look into is what a patient teen looks like? If the Holy Spirit is growing patience in you, and you're obeying his command to be patient, then what kind of person will you be?

#### Calm in adversity

The Holy Spirit gives us the ability though the fruit of patience to be calm in adversity and suffering, in a way that is impossible through worldly wisdom.

>**James 1:2-8** My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

We know from this passage that patience is not only a virtue in and of itself, but that it's doing something to us: it's conforming us to Christ. So a patient teen is calm, and even joyful in suffering, knowing that they're displaying a fruit of the spirit, but also that the very fruit of patience is conforming them in other ways too.

#### Slow to anger

That same patience that allows us to be calm in suffering also keeps us from giving in to anger. Richard Strauss brings out some interesting points, some of which we've already covered, as well as something new.

>Long-suffering is actually two Hebrew words, the first meaning “long” or “slow,” and the second meaning “nostril,” “nose,” “face,” or “anger.” Obviously, long-suffering does not refer to a long nose. But it is interesting that the Hebrew uses the same word to mean either nose, face, or anger. Maybe that was because anger is clearly seen on the face and is sometimes expressed by snorting or wheezing through the nose. But anger is the foremost idea in this expression. It means literally “slow to anger” and is so translated in the New American Standard Bible, as well as in several passages of the King James Version (e.g. Nehemiah 9:17; Psalm 103:8; 145:8; Proverbs 14:29; 15:18; 16:32; Joel 2:13; Jonah 4:2; Nahum 1:3). It takes a long-suffering person a long time to get heated up with anger.
>
>The same concept appears in the New Testament as one Greek word, and it conveys exactly the same idea as the Old Testament expression. It means “long tempered,” or “slow to express wrath.” God’s long-suffering has to do with His wrath. He can get angry, as we shall see in the next chapter, but it takes Him an extremely long time to do so. His nature is to delay the expression of His wrath. He is of long endurance. Those obstinate Jews deserved to be destroyed immediately for their rebelliousness and disobedience. They would have driven anybody else to quick retaliation. But God postponed the execution of His judgment because He is a long-suffering God.

So we know that God's patience is literally his "slowness" to get angry, and we're commanded to emulate this patience and long-suffering as well. The Bible has other remarks regarding this though.

>**Proverbs 16:32** He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

>**Proverbs 14:29** He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

>**Proverbs 19:11** The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.

So the patient teen is better than someone who is has conquered cities, and is extremely wise, and is known for his or her ability to let things go. So if you are mastering the ability to be patient and slow to anger, you're accomplishing greater things than Napoleon, Alexander, or Julius Caesar. You're wiser than anyone who is quick to anger, and whether you know it or not you are glorified for your ability to overlook wrong that is done to you.

Finally, James 1:20 explicitly says that the "wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God," so your carnal anger is accomplishing nothing.

#### Slow to speak

One of the more challenging qualities we develop with the help of the Lord is the ability to be slow to speak.

>**James 1:19-20** Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

And why are we concerned about our speech? Because the tongue is incredibly dangerous.

>**James 3:1-12** My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body. Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body. Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
>
>Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth! And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell. For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind: But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
>
>Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter? Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.

Are you kissing your mother with that mouth? That's basically what the Bible is asking in this passage. How can you - as a follower of Christ - use the same mouth to bless God and curse men?

But Proverbs has more to say about our speech:

>**Proverbs 17:28** Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

Basically Solomon is saying "talk less and people will think you're smarter."

>**Proverbs 29:20** Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.

>**Proverbs 25:11-12** A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

These two passages again say someone who is hasty in their speech is a fool, but a wise, patient believer slowly and carefully chooses words, especially when correcting or confronting someone. The Bible also says that "out of the abundance of the heart, a man speaks," so what's coming out in your speech? Patience, or anger?

A teen who is growing the fruit of patience will speak less, but when they do talk, they will say things worth hearing. When we were in college, this was said about Mrs. Olinda, that she didn't talk often, but when she did it was worth listening. And that's because she was applying patience to her speech.

### Conclusions

In summary, we are commanded to be patient, but with the understanding that we are being empowered by the Holy Spirit working within us to that end. We can't obey on our own, we must do it in the power of the Spirit. This patience makes us calm in adversity, slow to anger, and slow to speak. Do you display these qualities in your own living?
