This week we're starting our look at the fruit of the spirit called peace. When we look at peace, especially as it relates to God, it can be somewhat confusing. Is it internal? External? A state of being or an action?

It is defined as "freedom from disturbance; quiet and tranquility" or "freedom from or the cessation of war or violence" or "freedom from civil disorder" or finally "freedom from dispute or dissension between individuals or groups."

We know because it's a fruit of the spirit that it's something internal first, as well as something we act out as we mature. So we're not really talking about political peace or civil order. So how accurate are the first and last definitions when it comes to the fruits of the spirit?

Let's do a quick survey of some verses that talk about peace as it relates to God and his character.

## God's peace

What are some passages that talk about the internal quality of peace in the trinity?

**Mark 4:35-41** *And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?*

**Isaiah 9:6** *For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.*

**Romans 16:20** *And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.*

When we look at the three members of the Trinity, we see peace by nature. God's perfect creation didn't involve carnage and war, everything was perfectly in harmony and serving a purpose.

When we look at the ministry of Jesus, he was calm and peaceful in his demeanor, although he made it clear that he was able to rise up in anger if needed. When they were in the boat, he was the only one who was able to rest, because he was peaceful even in spite of his circumstance.

The Holy Spirit is called the Comforter, and brings peace to believers as he ministers.

## The peace of God

In Scripture the peace of God is a gift given to us.

**Isaiah 26:3** *Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.*

This passage is important because it highlights a critical aspect of peace. It's not natural. In fact, our sinful state makes us naturally violent and fearful. We're kept in a state of peace by trusting and focusing on God. This verse says that the believer whose mind is focused on God will have peace.

**Philippians 4:7** *And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.*

**John 14:25-31** *These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.*

John Piper writes on this passage:

>*It is one of the most amazing and wonderful and sweetest things in the Bible to realize that just hours before Jesus was crucified he was concerned for the peace and the joy and the faith of his followers. Think of it. He is about to be tortured to death with one of the most horrific means of torture ever devised, and his burden was to solidify in the souls of his followers peace and joy and faith.*

>*What would we be doing if we knew that we would not only be killed tomorrow, but tortured for who knows how long? My guess is we would be desperate to find our own peace, and our own joy and our own faith. We would probably not be pouring out our concern for the peace and joy and faith of our friends and family. Unless Jesus had filled us with his peace and joy and faith, so we were free to think of others.*

>*Peace. Joy. Faith. This was his burden for his followers the night before his suffering. Amazing. Look at verse 27. Peace.... Look at verse 28b. Joy.... Look at verse 29. Faith....*

>*This is what he is aiming at just before he suffers. I want you to have peace. I want you to be deeply joyful. I want you to believe in what I say and what I do — to have unshakable faith. I want you to have the kind of peace that I give, not the world. The kind of joy that I give, not the world. The kind of faith, I give, not the world. That is the practical outcome of these verses — indeed the outcome of this night. This suffering. This gospel.*

Many writers parallel peace with joy, although I think the two are distinct. I think that peace - according to scripture - is an attribute of God's character that leads him to desire harmony and unity, and one that's mirrored in our own. I think it's also an aversion to violence and carnal conflict, one that's manifested both mentally and physically, which we'll get into more next time.

Christ reminds us that we need not be fearful because we have the peace of God, which he has promised to provide through the Holy Spirit. So a believer has peace through the Holy Spirit because his mind is focused on God. The negative of that is that if you are fearful, your mind is not "stayed" on God.

## Conclusion

God is able to offer peace to us because he has already paid the price for our sins. The death of Christ makes peace possible, and allows God to express his desire for peace to us. The God of Peace makes the peace of God a reality for believers. We have assurance that our past sins are covered, our present trials are being watched over, and that our future in heaven is secure.

This means that God has established peace between himself and humanity, which makes peace with others, peace with ourselves, and eventually universal peace possible. And those are things we'll study next time.
