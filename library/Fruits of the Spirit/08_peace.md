Last week we studied how peace is a part of God's character, and it's also something that we're commanded to emulate in our own lives. However, we also realized that peace has already been given to us, but we simply must allow that peace to stamp out our fear and anxiety.

## Peaceful Living

What kind of lifestyle should you be seeking to live?

### Submissive to God's timing

If you are developing as a believer and growing the fruits of the spirit, you should be outwardly submissive to the timing that God has placed on the different events in your life. A peaceful person is not anxious about *when* things will happen, because they know two important facts: God works all things for the good of his children, and he cares deeply about us. In fact, last week we concluded that peace is only possible because of the price that God has paid so we could be made right with him.

### Not pursuing violence and anger

I think that scripture makes it clear that if we are growing the fruit of peace in our lives, that we will not be thrilled by violence or anger. Even God, in his judgement of Israel said in Jeremiah:

> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.

God was capable of passing judgement and disciplining his children - both things we're also commanded to do - without thinking evil thoughts, or wanting bad things for them.

God isn't a sadist who gets a thrill out of suffering, and we shouldn't either. It's dangerous for us to indulge in plotting, scheming thinking where we seek harm for others and enjoy seeing it happen.

In fact, we're supposed to pursue harmony and unity among our brothers and sisters in Christ, and really when you think about it, the whole world. Our primary means of bringing glory to God in the church age is through fulfilling the Great Commission, which commands us to:

> Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen.

We're supposed to be making disciples of the entire world, and part of being a disciple is being made right with your master. So in a sense, our mission here on earth is to bring people into a peaceful relationship with God.

In the Beatitudes, Christ also says:

> Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.

We're not only expected to be peaceful in our thinking, but we're supposed to be pursuing peace externally. What's interesting in this passage is that the term *peacemaker* is used. However, this is a point where many Christians differ on the execution. Does being peaceful and abhorring violence mean that it is never right to fight? What do you think?

### Focused on God

Lastly, we need to keep our eyes on God. He makes it clear that he'll keep us in a state of peace if we remain focused and resting in him. For believers that's a natural thing, even though we still fight. In other words, an unbeliever is naturally focused on themselves and their own desires, and it would seem unusual to do otherwise. As Christians, it should feel wrong for us to be self-centered instead of God-centered.

If we keep our hearts and minds "stayed" on God though, we're allowing ourselves to be blessed with the peace of God that passes all understanding. If you want to enjoy God's peace, you need to discipline your heart and mind to pay attention to God first!

## Conclusion

Peaceful believers are focused on God, submissive to his timing, and avoid violence and anger and instead pursue peace with others.

We realize that true peace in a universal sense won't come until after the tribulation, but what an encouragement to know that it's possible between God and believers right now!

I want to encourage seniors especially to make sure you're here on Wednesday night, we're going to take some time to deal directly with the issues that you're facing.
