We’re going to discuss some of the most important ideas surrounding the discussion on origins; we’ll cover cosmology, the young or old earth debate, and the theory of evolution, among other things. Many of the ideas in this section are going to be more challenging, so I am going to ask you before we begin to pay close attention and take advantage of your ability to raise your hand! These are critical concepts for you to understand because they are buttresses that people will use to hold up arguments against Christianity.

## Cosmology

Cosmology is the branch of metaphysics that deals with the origin, structure, and space-time relationships of the universe. That basically means that it deals with how *what is* came *to be*. It’s been intensely debated for a very long time by Christians, Muslims, Jews, atheists, agnostics, and every religion that’s existed.

When it comes down to it, there are two basic views of cosmology:

1. The universe is eternal and possibly infinite
2. The universe had a distinct cause & origin

So let’s break down the two opposing views.

### Eternalism

Eternalists have existed for quite some time, and it actually began as a pagan philosophy. The universe was proposed to have existed eternally either in cycles or in one uniform state. In other words, there was no first cause to the universe. This view is usually descended from the presupposition that there is no creator, which we debunked previously.

The scientific equivalent became the [Steady State theory][1], that the universe had operated on the same level forever and was continuously generating new matter, but this theory was basically destroyed by Edwin Hubble's discovery that the entire universe is expanding. Since the universe was expanding, that meant that at some point it was created, which led to the Big Bang theory.

However, as time progressed, a new theory was proposed where the universe expanded and collapsed endlessly, which blended nicely with the evidence while eliminating a distinct point of creation. In other words, the universe is like a bouncy ball that uses the energy from falling to rebound back into the air. Basically the explosive force of the Big Bang was created by the Big Crunch that preceded it.

### Cause & Effect

On the other hand, those who believe in cause & effect – which aren't all Christians – proposed that the universe has not, and could not, always exist. There must have been a first cause, because without a first cause you fall into an infinite regress. In order to get to this exact moment in time, you would have to have an infinite number of “moments” before and after it.

Now hold your hand in front of your face and bring it halfway to your nose again and again…

You’ll never get there in theory because every distance can be divided in half. Now in the sense of time, if you had infinite time before and after now, you could never get there because existence would have had to “happen” an infinite number of times to get to now. Without definite beginning and ending points, now is a completely meaningless concept.

Not only does infinite regress pose a problem, but you have the issue of motivation. Unless you acknowledge a first cause, there is no motivator to set everything else into motion. The bouncy ball can't start to bounce without energy being imparted to it in the first place. Both the [Kalam Cosmological Argument and the traditional Cosmological Argument][2] are covered in this article. 

The Cosmological Argument can be summarized as:

1. Every being has a cause
2. A causal loop cannot exist
3. A causal chain cannot be of infinite
4. Therefore, an *uncaused* First Cause exists

The Kalam Cosmological Argument is as follows:

1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause
2. The Universe began to exist
3. Therefore, the Universe had a cause

It's important to note the objection later in the article, that neither of these arguments "prove" there is a God, merely that there is a first cause. However, they are useful to eliminate the first presupposition that there is no creator as a possibility, leaving the debate between whether or not this first cause is God or impersonal.

Science also [supports the idea][3] of a finite universe:

> In the early 1800s, German astronomer Heinrich Olbers argued that the universe must be finite. If the Universe were infinite and contained stars throughout, Olbers said, then if you looked in any particular direction, your line-of-sight would eventually fall on the surface of a star. Although the apparent size of a star in the sky becomes smaller as the distance to the star increases, the brightness of this smaller surface remains a constant. Therefore, if the Universe were infinite, the whole surface of the night sky should be as bright as a star. Obviously, there are dark areas in the sky, so the universe must be finite.

Also, as we already mentioned, the entire known universe is observed through galactic red-shift to be expanding away from us in all directions. Which means that there was at some point in the past an event from which the entire universe was stretched out from. This spawned the Big Bang theory in humanistic circles, but actually conforms to Scripture in several important ways.

Many verses[^fn-scroll] specifically indicate that the heavens were stretched out by God, while others refer to the heavens being like a scroll that God will roll up in the end of the universe as we know it.

Interestingly, our solar system appears to be the center of the universe’s expansion, which is incredibly improbable if creation was a random event, especially given how rare habitable planets are on the scale of the known universe. We’ll cover universal expansion in the next section as well since it related closely to the age of the earth.

## Young vs. Old Earth

Another issue that is hotly debated both within and without Christian circles is the age of the earth. There are a range of theories, but they all fall into two categories. Those who propose a young Earth generally proposes an age of the Earth that is in the thousands, and for the sake of the discussion we will say that it’s roughly 6,000 years, plus or minus 2,000.

Those in favor of an old Earth proposes a number of ages, but all of them are in the millions to billions of years, with 4.5 billion being widely accepted based on radioactive decay.

So the question is, why can both positions be so strongly backed? Shouldn’t the evidence point one way or the other? If both positions have evidence, then let’s take a look at it, considering Big Idea #1 in the back of our minds.

### Old Earth

Old Earth supporters, some of whom are Christians, look at varying sources.

Starlight is one of the primary “hinge” facts that seems to point to a very old universe, at least 13 billion years old, and probably more. Can anyone explain why that is? The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second or 186,000 miles per second. Based on triangulation, light intensity, and red/blue shifting it’s possible to determine fairly accurately the distance to other objects because we know (mostly) the speed of light. So since we know lightspeed, the distance of a light year is how far light travels in a year. Meaning that the light from the furthest galaxies should have taken *13 to 15 billion years* to get here.

Some criticisms of the objectivity of lightspeed have been proposed, but as far as we are able to tell, these figures are accurate under normal physics. This question is one that is often inelegantly handled by creationists, but I will propose a solution later on.

Arctic ice is another piece of evidence that seems to point to an old earth, because there are thousands and thousands of thin layers that seem to have been deposited on a yearly basis.

The oceans are getting saltier each year, and if you trace that increase backward through time, it would have taken far more than 6,000 years to get as salty as it is now.

Sediment layers are also fairly regular, like the arctic ice layers, and seem to point to gradual addition of layer upon layer. Erosion likewise points to gradual shaping of the landscape over millions of years.

### Young Earth

Young earth supporters - who are basically forced into the Creationist camp since evolution isn’t possible on such a short time scale - have plenty of supporting evidence as well.

For instance, the earth’s magnetic field is decaying, and if you assume that it decayed regularly, it would have been dangerously powerful if the earth were old. However, based on a younger time frame, it would have always been within safe levels for known life.

Also, the levels of helium released into the atmosphere are consistent with a 6,000 (plus or minus 2,000) year old Earth.

Now, here’s ocean salt again… on the other side of the chart. Can anyone take a stab at why it’s on both? If you assume that God created the oceans salty in order to support sea life, then the salt levels are right where you would expect them to be 6,000 years ago.

Fossils also seem to support a young earth for two primary reasons:

1. Some of them are deposited across layers, meaning that fish have been found upright in the sediment layers, spanning what should have been millions of years of deposits. First, it’s impossible that soft organic material would stay upright and preserved long enough to be buried that way naturally, and second it points to a cataclysmic event that rapidly destroyed a wide variety of life all at once.

2. Some dinosaur bones still contain blood cells and other tissue. Recently, non-fossilized skin [was discovered][4] in Canada (amusingly, no one can explain how skin survived for 70 million years, but they've dismissed the possibility that it's only a few thousand years old). In theory such tissues can last only a few thousand years, maybe 65,000. So it appears that dinosaurs lived more recently than proposed by old earth supporters, which throws off a number of time estimates for other fields.

The arctic ice also presents contradictory evidence, because during the second world war a flight of bombers with their fight escort was forced to land in the arctic circle. The crews were rescued, but the planes had to be left behind. In 1992 they were recovered, but had to be lifted *270 feet* out of the ice. Clearly ice layers are not uniformly deposited.

Starlight is one of the most interesting and difficult things to deal with. As I mentioned, it’s one of the primary criticisms of a young earth model, because we can see galaxies that are approximately 13 to 15 billion light years away. Based on the universal expansion being centered in our area of the universe, that means our universe is at least 26 billion light years across, which is inconceivably vast.

How then can we explain the fact that we can see those galaxies if we believe that the earth is around 6,000 years old? Some have attempted to explain that God created light that was “on the way” but there is one problem. Anyone want to guess? Back in 1987 a star exploded. Except that it didn’t really explode in 1987 according to the speed of light. It exploded 168,000 years ago on the outskirts of the Tarantula nebula in a nearby galaxy. But the earth is only 6,000 years old, so that means that in fact that star never really existed since the light at creation would have already reflected its dead state. So is it consistent with God’s character that He would create a charade? That everything more than 6,000 light years away isn’t real?

Others have proposed that everything is in fact less than 6,000 light years away, and we’ve just really, really messed up our triangulation. Personally I think this falls into the “desperate” category. Our own galaxy is more than 6,000 light years away in places, and if everything were packed in that tightly we’d be experiencing a great deal more radiation and gravity tides than we measure.

A last theory, proposed by Humphreys, involves the relationship between gravity and time. I would recommend that you read the [separate handout][5] for more information on this theory as it's quite complex.

### Competing Evidence

We have covered the competing evidence, but what does all that mean? Some indicates that the earth is old while some indicates that the earth is young. The Earth can’t be both old and young, but here's a critical point: evidence pointing to an old earth can be accounted for in a young earth model, but not the other way around. Once again, keep in mind that these are things that can be used in defense, but shouldn’t be thought of as primary tools. No one is convinced into heaven, so these arguments and theories should be used wisely.
