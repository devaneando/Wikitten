## How do You Feel About Science?

Now you might be asking why on earth this matters. What do feelings matter when it comes to science? The fact is that many of us – try as we might – are very influenced by feelings and instinctive reactions toward ideas and concepts. That’s why adults and children get into arguments over “new” and “old” fashioned things.

Do any of you feel hostile toward science? Don’t worry, we’re not going to lock you away, but some people really do feel a hostility and distrust of science.

How about indifference? Maybe you didn’t write anything at all, or just couldn’t figure out what to say. Is science just not an issue for you? Could you really care less about carbon-dating and fossil records?

Some of you might feel separated, or cut off from science. It’s OK for them to do their thing, as long as they don’t mess with religion, or politics, or the way your food is prepared. As long as they do that, you won’t tell them how to believe or run their lives.

Some of you might respect or admire science and scientific achievements. Some of you may even be considering a career in it.

The question for us as Christians is how well do our feelings toward science match up with Scripture. But first let’s take a look at the definition of science, since it’s critical to know what something is prior to making judgments on it.

## What is Science?

So what is science, in the most basic sense?

> Science is the intellectual and practical activity of studying the natural world through observation and experiment.

Science is study. The study of the natural world. So what is the natural world? The natural world is everything that can be sensed by us and interacted with to some degree. The phrase “natural world” is easily the most important part of this whole sentence, because it is probably the center of most contention between science and Christianity. Because it runs right up against one of the central elements of Christianity: miracles. But in order to study you have to observe, and to make sure that what you observe is correct you have to experiment to see if you can reproduce it

## How Should Christians Respond to Science?

When we study scripture, we see several passages that should affect how we respond to science. Remember that our primary source for defending scripture is scripture!

### Romans 1:20-23

In Romans, Paul clearly indicates support for empirical study by referencing our observations of general revelation. Verse 20 in particular sheds light on God's expectation that we will observe him:

>  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: 

However, we are warned that whenever man places his reasoning and conclusions above God, he descends into idolatry and self-destruction. Verses 21-23 show this in action:

> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

Romans 1 demonstrates an important precedent: we are expected to use reason and observation, but we cannot ever assume that our thinking or experiences can trump the truth of God's word.

### Psalm 19:1-6

Another passage indicating the clear testimony in creation of God's work, which can - and is meant to - be observed.

> The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

> Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.

> There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.

> Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,

> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

> His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.

### Daniel 1:17-21

The Hebrews are praised for their understanding of the sciences, along with their wisdom and physical abilities. This isn't necessarily something that's required in God's eyes, in fact he often uses the weak things to confound the strong! However, it enabled them to accomplish a task he had set before them in his sovereignty.

> As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

### 1 Timothy 6:20-21

> O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called: Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.

We are warned to be critical of science so that we are prepared against pseudo-scientific opposition to truth. By critical, I do not mean unreasonable or unthinking, in fact I mean the opposite. We are to diligently analyze and consider the methods and conclusions of science, so that we can better see counterfeits. The better you know the real thing, the more easily you can spot a fake.

### 2 Corinthians 10:3-6

> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: (For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ; And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

We are told to bring our thoughts into captivity, subjecting our minds to the knowledge of God, but not just for our own sake, but so that we can better fight against arguments and opinions raised against God. In fact, this is a great passage to consider as an apologist's commission.

## Scriptural Conclusions

Just as the preceding passages are in no way an exhaustive compilation, the following conclusions are also simplified, and there are more shades of grey than we can get into here. But they're a good place to start, and if you hear something that "raises your hackles" then it might be a starting point for more serious study and thinking. So based on those passages, several of which we’ve reviewed previously, what can we conclude about science?

### Science is not Evil

Science is a tool, it is not inherently moral. All tools can be used or misused, and you should not blame the evils performed by men on the instrument.

How many of you support gun control? Why is that? It helps keep guns out of the hands of those who cannot use them correctly (in the technical sense) and in ways that are appropriate. Does that make you opposed to guns? No, not necessarily.

How many of you like guns? Does that make you a raging homicidal maniac? No, not necessarily.

Therefore, it’s irresponsible and incorrect to blame science for the misdeeds of the scientist, and it’s also incorrect to assume that a scientist is evil because of his trade. However, it's also valid to conclude that science - in the wrong hands or without training - has clearly yielded terrible results in the past, just like a gun in the hands of a child. Just because we can doesn't always mean we should.

### Science is not Supreme

Secondly, and more important, is the fact that science isn’t superior to revelation. It also isn’t good, just as it isn’t evil. We know from the Bible that science will not save mankind physically, neither can it meet our spiritual and emotional needs. It's just one tool at our disposal to try and subdue and care for creation as we've been commanded. Science should never take first place in our worldview.

### The Place for Science

So if science isn’t evil, and it isn’t good, but just a tool, where does it belong?

Science, just like reason, tradition, and culture, has a place as one of our means of gaining knowledge about God and His creation. Science has revealed many things to us that enhance, not detract from our appreciation of God. For instance, look at the following images.

The Big Ideas also help us remember the proper place for science:

1. Identical evidence leads to different conclusions based on one's presuppositions.
2. The world consistently and comprehensively makes sense only when interpreted through the narrative of Scripture.
3. God is the ultimate fact that explains every other fact.
