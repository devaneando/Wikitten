# What is a narrative?

In the simplest terms, a narrative is defined as:

> A spoken or written account of connected events; a story.

A narrative takes discrete events and weaves them together in a way that supplies the reader or hearer with a sense of context, of how the events belong together.

## Metanarratives	

The term *[metanarrative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metanarrative)* means a story that explains other stories or a narrative that answers ultimate questions. What are some ultimate questions?

1. Where did I come from?
2. Where am I going?
3. Why am I here?
4. Am I responsible for my actions?

As human beings, we love stories. We like to listen to them, we like to create them. If you don't think you can create stories, wait until you're pulled over and the officer asks why you were driving so fast! We like stories because they help us understand concepts that are bigger than us. They help us answer small questions and big questions.

## Paradigm

The term *paradigm* means:

> A typical example or pattern of something; a model *or* a worldview underlying the theories and methodology of a particular scientific subject.

We're going to be using the terms *worldview* and *paradigm* throughout the class, so make sure that you understand that these terms are referring to a person's metanarrative that they use to put their world in context.

## Why does this matter?

So what does storytelling have to do with defending our faith? We don't think in a vacuum. That is, when you hear that someone died, usually people ask questions like *how*, *when*, or *why*, in an attempt to place a traumatic event in *context*. We're designed to want to know why things are the way they are.

No matter what you do, if it has no meaning or context to it, it has little satisfaction. How many of you remember "Wax on, wax off" from *The Karate Kid*? The job he was doing made no sense, which led to frustration.

When we look at the world around us, we start to assemble data according to a metanarrative. Imagine that you're on a crime scene, and you see a person with a gun shot wound. Do you know for a fact that they were shot? No, but you deduce that since they were wounded by a bullet that they were shot with a gun, which was fired by a person. You didn't witness all of that, but your brain has already started to construct a story that makes all the facts fit together.

What we need to realize is that real battleground in apologetics isn't facts, carbon-dating, and prayer in school. The real issue at stake is making sense of our existence, because that's what we're all trying to do, and we're the ones with the only metanarrative that can completely explain our existence.

### Conceiving the World

James Orr recognized that apologists needed to stop seeing Christianity as an isolated event that happened inside of history, but rather as a metanarrative that contained history.

> The opposition which Christianity has to encounter is no longer contained to special doctrines or points of supposed conflict with the natural sciences.... [it] extends to the whole manner of conceiving the world, and of man's place in it, the manner of conceiving the entire system of things, natural and moral, of which we form a part....

This quote comes from *The Christian View of God and the World* which was written by Orr in 1893. I would contend that until we are convinced in our own minds and convicted in our own hearts that the Bible is a comprehensive and powerful explanation of every facet of existence, we're simply trying to amass more facts than the other religions.

## Biblical Metanarrative

So let's take a look at the narrative Scripture offers us. Theologians have boiled down the whole of Scripture to three main points.

1. **Creation:** The Bible asserts that everything was created by the willful act of an omnipotent, omnipresent, omniscient God.
2. **Fall:** In an act of rebellion, man marred creation and himself, bringing a curse on the entire universe.
3. **Redemption:** God is actively working to redeem, or buy back, creation, completely eradicate sin and its effects, and bring man back into complete fellowship with Himself.

The Biblical metanarrative explains from beginning to end our existence. It also explains how that existence is supposed to work. Scripture tackles issues like absolute morality, the presence and origin of evil, our relationship with the Creator, and why He wants us back.

## Are there alternatives?

However, several alternative views on the universe have been proposed. Here are a few examples, although this is certainly not a definitive or exhaustive list. Also, the book [*What is Truth*](http://www.bjupress.com/product/271783) offers an excellent primer in comparative worldview studies. Although intended for high school students, I highly recommend it for believers of all ages as "light" reading to broaden your understanding.

1. [Polytheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism): the belief in many gods, examples being the Greek & Roman religions, as well as Hinduism.
2. [Pantheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism): this is the belief that all things are god, both animate and inanimate, meaning there is not one distinct, personal being that is god.
3. [Darwinism](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14558/14558-h/14558-h.htm): a belief system that advocates survival as a primary goal, and specifically that survival is a way to determine superiority.
4. [Marxism](http://www.marxists.org/subject/students/index.htm): a political and economic worldview that sees conflict through the lens of class warfare and focuses on the concepts of ownership and hierarchy.
5. [Atheism](http://www.investigatingatheism.info/meaning.html): the belief that there is no god, or gods, of any kind.
6. Postmodernism: a very broad belief system that rejects the idea of absolute truth and knowledge and embraces the physical principle of relativity, applying it to philosophy and morality.

One key thing you need to remember is that all world views have a narrative element, but many of them struggle to answer the questions posed by existence. That's where most of them fall short, or even borrow from Biblical elements.

Those three tenets are mirrored in almost every other worldview, so we'll use them to compare alternatives to Scripture. A key for us as apologists is to understand the superiority of the Biblical narrative over all other narratives. However, here I must point out that we don't believe the Bible because it appears in our own subjective evaluation to be superior. We believe it because God has by his grace given us the faith to do so, lest we assume that we're more intelligent, or superior, for believing the "right" things.

## Case Study: Atheism

Let's take an opportunity to review one alternative worldview that has been proposed: that there is no God to begin with. Don't ever let an atheist tell you that he's only interested in hard science and has no interest in narratives or world views. Take this quote from Lee Smolin:

> In the 20th century science has replaced religion as the dominant cosmological authority.... At the present time, for many of the cultures of the planet, we physicists are the official makers and keepers of the story of the cosmos.

How does atheism answer the fundamental question, where am I from? How did I get here? Gerald Schroeder says:

> Cleverly, life scaled the mountain of complexity.... Somehow, the dust spewed into space by the nuclear furnace of a bygone supernova has become a human brain that learned to make nuclear reactors here on earth. Philosophizing about the origin of our origins, cosmic or biological, may be fascinating, but rarely does it accomplish more than raising other questions.

Not a lot of facts there, mostly just good old fashioned storytelling. Note the use of words like *cleverly* and *somehow*. Ironically, in his own statement that it's futile to wonder about origins, he's spun off a narrative.

Even attempts to "jump the gun" by looking for the actual event of the beginning of the universe leave an enormous gap between 4-dimensional space unfolding from an 11-dimensional lattice and us sitting here on Sunday morning. However, this is the battlefield where many atheists have chosen to fight, so we're going to spend a whole lesson just discussing origins later on.

How does atheism answer the Fall, or the problem of evil? Basically it avoids it. Richard Dawkins says:

> The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind pitiless indifference.

Atheism proposes that there is no evil precisely because there is no purpose, no design. Basically he just said that there's no point to existence.

How does atheism handle the future, our redemption?

Carl Sagan instructs:

> Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors.... Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel.... How eager they are to kill one another.... Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

So there is a murky past, a meaningless present, and a hopeless future in store based on the atheistic worldview. Why would anyone choose to believe that?

It probably has something to do with the statements Scripture makes about responsibility to God, our sin nature, and our purpose. Would you be willing to trade redemption for absolution? That's what atheism is doing for people. It's a scientific Dr. Phil telling them that it's not their fault.

## Comparative study

We need to analyze alternatives side by side with Scripture. When that is done, it becomes clear that Scripture can far more comprehensively explain life, the universe, and everything. However, just because we have answers doesn't mean people will like them.

This leads us to the second "big idea" of the class.

Big Idea #2:

> The world consistently and comprehensively makes sense only when interpreted through the narrative presented by Scripture.

Now, let this soak into your brain (as well as your notepad). Obviously part of our goal is to demonstrate that Scripture is the superior explanation for the universe. But more importantly, what comes from that realization?

Once we show people that Scripture is superior in its ability to make sense of life, they must then be convicted of their need for salvation. There are many self-proclaimed sinners out there, Lucifer first and foremost, that know the truth and still defy God.

By peeling away the diversions of evolution, basic goodness, and other humanistic concepts, we can show people that the real reason they don't believe is simply because they don't want to.
