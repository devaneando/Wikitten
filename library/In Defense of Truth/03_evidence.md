## When We Fail

Someone posed a situation to me the first week that - with his permission - I'm sharing with you for your thinking.

He and his wife were witnessing to a woman who responded by rejecting them, and telling them she didn't want any part of what they were offering. She was extremely ill and the prognosis was extremely grim.

This is totally normal for people to lash out when they are afraid and shocked by bad news. However, a short time later this woman died, with no evidence that she accepted the gospel.

### The Question

Is it appropriate to stop when asked to? Why or why not?

### The Answer

I believe that backing off when asked to is appropriate, realizing that we've shared the gospel, and realizing that God's sovereign hand is in control of the situation. We have no control over whether someone will die now or 30 years from now, we can only obey the command that we've been given. We're not entirely certain from Scripture what process God uses in election, and how it ties together with our actions, but we must rest in the assurance that we've been obedient, while still allowing the reality of hell to penetrate our daily living and our desire to see souls saved.

## Review

Let’s start off reviewing 1 Peter 3:15, the verse we covered in our first class.

> But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

As we discussed in the first lesson, there is a huge “tug of war” between evidence and belief. While we did dissect the difference between the two, the real question is which is valid and why. If we’re going to be effective apologists, we need to know which of these motivates us, and which one motivates those who attack the faith. Do we believe because of the evidence, or do we see the evidence because of what we believe? Do we just assume the Bible is true and go from there? Do we need to compile evidence to prove the Bible before we believe?

The relationship between these two concepts is critical for you to understand. Much like the issue of God’s sovereignty and our free will, the answer to which one is the right approach for use in apologetics is “both.” However, we’ll take a close look at the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches.

Does overwhelming evidence make something true or false? What if you found someone who had been shot with a gun registered to me with my fingerprints on the grip, and he and I had just gotten into a big fight a few hours before, after which no one had seen either of us until the murder. Am I guilty? Did I do it? How can you know for sure? What would it take for you to be wrong?

On the other hand, I mentioned before that ultimately much of what we see as “solid evidence” can be interpreted multiple ways (the Grand Canyon) depending on your beliefs. However, can your beliefs and decisions actually affect reality? Can you believe - or not believe - something so strongly that it does in fact happen? While we might not actually come out and say we function this way, how often do we?

## Terminology

### A Posteriori

The term a posteriori simply means “from the latter” in Latin. It basically means “because of this, then this.” As a logic statement you would say if, then. This is also known as *empirical* thinking.

This is the foundation of inductive reasoning, which leads to one of the two main approaches to apologetics. I could observe that people grow old and eventually die, and conclude based on that observation that humans eventually die.

### A Priori

A Priori simply means “from before” or basically something assumed beforehand. A classic statement would be “assuming that A is true, then B must also be true.” This is informally known as *intuitive*  or *deductive* thinking.

This is where we get the idea of deduction. For example, since I am human, and all humans naturally die, then one day I will die. This statement is true as long as I am human, but if I weren’t then it would be a false argument.

## Two Approaches

Now let’s take a look at the two approaches to apologetics - *evidentialism* and *presuppositionalism* - based on evidence and presupposition before we make our decision.

### Evidentialism

Evidentialism relies heavily on the use of facts, proofs, and other evidence to conclusively support the truth of Scripture by compiling evidence and then saying “because of all this evidence, Scripture can be safely proven true.” Why don't you try to assemble an inductive or empirical argument in favor of the Bible?

The weakness of this approach is that we can never experience everything or see all the evidence, so it’s possible that something disproves our arguments that we simply don’t know about. For instance, even though I’ve observed many people growing older and passing away, does that mean that all humans have died? Scripture records two people in particular that were taken to heaven before dying, so my argument isn’t completely true.

An evidentialist would tend to be cautious, analytical, and thoughtful, but run the risk of not knowing all the evidence, and thus drawing an incorrect conclusion.

### Presuppositionalism

Presuppositionalism simply generates logical statements from prior assumptions in an effort to prove or disprove a certain point of view. Thus, we might say that “Assuming that there is no God, then there is no basis for morality.” If it were true that there were no God, then it would be a valid statement. However, everything stated a priori can be unhinged based on that one assumption. Why don't you try to make an *a priori* arguments or statement?

All I have to do to prove that there is an absolute morality (in this particular argument) is to prove that there is a God. Going back to the argument that since I am human, I will one day die, the biggest weakness is simply the assumption that I am human. That’s a safe bet in this argument, but when I say things like “Women like white chocolate, my wife is a woman, my wife likes white chocolate,” then I start getting into rough territory!

A presuppositionalist would be much more likely to be a “trial and error” type person. You might run with an argument until it doesn’t work and then be forced to start over completely.

## Which One Do We Use?

So now it all comes down to it. Which one is better? Are you an inductive or deductive thinker?

The good thing is that all of your are right. They both serve a purpose and are acceptable to use in argument and thinking, but should be used carefully so that they don’t overstep their bounds. However, we’re going to conclude that one of them is ultimately the hinge of all apologetics and thought, and to do that we need to look at Romans 1:18-28.

### Analysis of Romans 1:18-28

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold [suppress] the truth in unrighteousness;

God reveals Himself through observable actions to mankind. In this case His wrath is made known when He gives people up to reprobate minds.

> Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.

This verse reflects that man knows God intuitively (in them). You can know there is a God without special instruction, but there is instruction available as stated by the phrase “shewed it unto them.” Thus, we are shown that humans are capable of reasoning based on an assumption, or deducing. John 1:9 and Romans 2:14 both also state that there is a “built in” sense of God in all humans, regardless of knowledge. We are also created in the “image of God” according to Genesis, meaning that we naturally carry attributes of Him in us, one of them being an innate sense of justice and morality, though that doesn’t mean we use them. This intuitive sense, not only of God’s authority and existence, but also of morality, is commonly refered to as “conscience.”

> For the invisible things of him from [since] the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:

Knowledge of God has been available before the written Word through creation. There is clearly knowledge of God to be found through inductive observation of the natural world which we can understand before ever being told the Gospel. This is observed (“are clearly seen”) natural revelation about God through His creation, which validates the use of empirical, inductive reasoning in our thought since our Creator expects us to collect the evidence of His handiwork and conclude that there was a Creator.

> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

Man’s idolatry is a conscious turning away from the truth of God found in creation and implanted in our hearts. It’s not a result of ignorance.

> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

Man can know God, and man can also choose to try and forget Him. This passage demonstrates the hand-in-hand relationship that evidence and belief, induction and deduction, and proof and assumptions have. We have been implanted with knowledge, and even characteristics, of God. But even beyond that we have been given evidence in creation that points toward God. The ultimate revelation of course was the Gospel, but God makes it clear that even without hearing the Gospel, there is enough reason for condemnation simply because you have ignored natural revelation.

So we can clearly see that Paul used inductive and deductive reasoning, but now we come to the biggest question. What’s the catch to his entire argument that man does know who God is? The catch is: is there a God?

## Big Idea #3

God is the ultimate fact that explains every other fact.

## Conclusion

So this means that ultimately, all reasoning has to assume one critical fact: that there is (or is not) a God. And that’s really the question that we need to answer as apologists. Is there a God, and how does His existence explain ours?

This leads us into next week’s lesson on Metaphysics & Epistemology. We’ll be discussing metaphysics, or the study of existence, as well as epistemology, or the study of knowledge – how we know what we know.
