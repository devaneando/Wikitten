## Who is Jesus Christ?

Here is a great paradox: how does it come about that a poor peasant, born in a cave, living on the outskirts of the Roman empire, who is finally crucified as a common criminal ever becomes so important? The story of Christ is the greatest illustration of the truth that God’s ways are not man’s ways.

How could Jesus have suffered the way He did if He was God? If He was God, did He give up some of His power when He became human?

Jesus was a Jew, born in the city of Bethlehem to very ordinary people. He was not heralded by men with fanfare and armies, just some shepherds, and later some wise men from a distant country. Even the angel choir seems to have gone unnoticed by everyone but the shepherds.

Not only that, but between His teen years and the age of 30, we have no record of His accomplishments, career, or location. How can anyone with such a small and low-profile history have been so significant?

These are all things that we take for granted, but before you were a believer, how much of this would have confused you? How many of us would vote for a president that we knew nothing about, who came from a bad part of town with rumors that he was illegitimate and had even spent some of his childhood out of the country?

That example is simply a “trust issue” question, and it doesn’t even broach the question of deity. So how do you think the unregenerate react to the claim that Christ was and is the Living God?

### Arguments Against Christ's Deity

There are several arguments against Christ’s deity.

#### Deistic

The first – the Deistic argument - is also the least likely that you’ll hear today, although people still use some elements of it.

Basically the argument is that according to Deistic thinking God doesn’t interact with His creation directly anymore. He set everything in motion and drew back from creation until it all “runs down” to the end.

Therefore Christ could not have been God since that would constitute a direct interaction. Whoever Christ was, he was not God.

However, He was certainly a great moral teacher and promoted good things while He was here. Thomas Jefferson was a leading proponent of this view of Christ. How many of you remember Scott Phillips discussion about the “Jefferson Bible”? In this Bible he removed every reference to Christ’s deity, miracles, and resurrection. His version of the Gospels ended with Christ lying in the grave, sealed in by the stone.

Now, almost no one would consider themselves a Deist anymore, but you will hear this phrase a lot:

> Well, Christ was a great teacher, a lot like Ghandi and Buddha, but I can’t accept that He was God.

We’ll counter this argument in a bit.

#### Naturalistic

The second will be far more prevalent in the Western culture that we live in. These arguments are presented by atheists in opposition to the deity of Christ.

Richard Dawkins proposes that the question of Christ’s deity is one that could only be answered scientifically. Listen to the following quote:

> Did Jesus have a human father, or was his mother a virgin at the time of his birth? Whether or not there is enough surviving evidence to decide it, this is a strictly scientific question with a definite answer in principle: yes or no. Did Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead? Did he himself come alive again, three days after being crucified? There is an answer to every such question, whether or not we can discover it in practice, and it is a strictly scientific answer. The methods we should use to settle the matter... would be purely and entirely scientific methods.... I suspect that alleged miracles provide the strongest reason many believers have for their faith; and miracles, by definition, violate the principles of science.

What is Dawkins doing with this statement? Did you catch the second sentence?

He’s a priori dismissing the evidence as unimportant. He blatantly states that evidence doesn’t matter, and science tells us those things are impossible, so they didn’t happen.

He’s also categorically dismissing the possibility of supernatural events a priori.

### Arguments For Christ's Deity

Fortunately there are an abundance of arguments and proofs in favor of Christ’s deity. Now, like the theodicy and defenses we studied previously, these are simply man-made arguments and can’t compare to Christ’s claims and statements themselves.

#### No Argument Argument

The “No-Argument Argument is summed up by B. B. Warfield as follows:

> A man recognizes on sight the face of his friend, or his own handwriting. Ask him how he knows his face to be that of his friend, or this handwriting to be his own, and he is dumb, or, seeking to reply, babbles nonsense. Yet his recognition rests on solid grounds, though he lacks analytical skill to isolate and state these solid grounds. We believe in God and freedom and immortality on good grounds, though we may not be able satisfactorily to analyse these grounds. No true conviction exists without adequate rational grounding in evidence. So, if we are solidly assured of the deity of Christ, it will be on adequate grounds, appealing to the reason. But it may well be on grounds not analysed, perhaps not analysable, by us, so as to exhibit themselves in the forms of formal logic.... The Christian's conviction of the deity of his Lord does not depend for its soundness on the Christian's ability convincingly to state the grounds of his conviction. The evidence he offers for it may be wholly inadequate, while the evidence on which it rests may be absolutely compelling.

This might seem disturbing after all the study and learning about defending the truth. Does this mean we don’t have to argue anything? Not necessarily. All he is saying is that accepting something as truth doesn’t rely on being able to prove it conclusively. Also, the truth of something doesn’t rest on your ability to prove it. Just because a candidate fumbles in a debate doesn’t mean their position is stupid.

Let’s apply this reasoning to everyday life: I can recognize Paulette pretty far away, but if you jumped me and asked me to prove it was her, you might not be satisfied with my arguments. That doesn’t mean it isn’t her, it just means that I wasn’t able to convince you.

How many of you have an argument prepared to prove that today is Sunday?

When we’re defending the deity of Christ, the burden of proof is not on you to prove his deity, it’s on the person who’s challenging it. However, your inability to argue effectively doesn’t mean Christ isn’t God.

#### Testimony in Solution

The very abundance and persuasiveness of the evidence of the deity of Christ greatly increases the difficulty of adequately stating it. This is true even of the scriptural evidence, as precise and definite as much of it is. For it is a true remark of Dr. Dale's that the particular texts in which it is definitely asserted are far from the whole, or even the most impressive, proofs which the Scriptures supply of our Lord's deity. He compares these texts to the salt-crystals which appear on the sand of the beach after the tide has receded:

> These are not the strongest, though they may be the most apparent, proofs that the sea is salt; the salt is present in solution in every bucket of sea-water.

The most powerful evidence for Christ’s deity is not even His direct claims that He is God. It’s woven throughout not only the Gospels, but the entire New Testament. All of it is hinged on the assumption that Christ was God. This means that any attempt to dissect the Bible as Jefferson did is futile, but it also means that Scripture was not edited “after the fact” in order to make Jesus look like God. There is no awkward transition in Scripture, nor do the dates of writing indicate that changes were made after the fact.

#### The Great Proof

The Great Proof, also presented by Warfield states that:

> If, indeed, it were asked what the most convincing proof of the deity of Christ is, perhaps the best answer would be, just Christianity. The new life He has brought into this world; the new creation which He has produced by His life and work in the world; here are at least His most palpable credentials.... “Should a voyager,” says Charles Darwin, “chance to be on the point of shipwreck on some unknown coast, he will most devoutly pray that the lesson of the missionary may have reached thus far. The lesson of the missionary is the enchanter's wand."

Warfield is arguing that the history of the church is the most compelling evidence that Christ was indeed who He claimed to be outside of Scripture. Few other religions have been persecuted, martyred, and attacked to the extent that Christianity has, and Christianity was the only religion founded on the assumption that martyrdom would follow. Also, Christianity did not propose a special reward for martyrs as Islam does. Christ simply said to take up our crosses and follow Him.

The church has against all odds grown through every persecution and spread peacefully to areas that war could never take it. Even today the church is spreading through Asia, and there are estimates that there are more Christians in China than in the West. In the late 20th century the Communist Party leaders concluded that there were more Christians than Communist members. The harder the oppression, the more the church has flourished. In fact, the greatest damage to the church seems to come when there is little or no opposition.

#### Liar, Lunatic, or Myth

This position was popularized by C.S. Lewis, but has been proposed in other places.

This argument rests on the idea that there cannot be a middle ground when it comes to the deity of Christ. He either is or He is not what He claims to be.

If Christ wasn’t God, then was He lying? If He was lying (which would have happened every time He claimed deity) then why was He never exposed? Second, why would He choose to try this route with the Jewish people who were the least likely to worship a human being? What did He stand to gain by continuing to lie? And why would his followers die for a lie?

Interestingly, very few people actually accuse Christ of being a liar, and most claim that He was a good person when you press them. But how can He be good if He lied constantly?

If someone makes the accusation that Christ was insane, then He would have been a liar on top of that. However, there is no evidence that anyone felt He was insane, and those around Him seemed to feel he was trustworthy. No matter how charismatic someone is, people know when someone is insane.

What about the idea that it was all made up? That even if there was a real person named Jesus who was crucified, that his story was later embellished for effect? Who comes up with a mythical figure who talks about people burning in hell and tries to foist this off as an attractive religion? And what motive did the disciples have? They wound up dead! Why would you craft a religion where all but one of the founders were murdered and the last one died on a prison island?

Some skeptics assume the first generation got it wrong, and a myth developed two or three generations later. However, within a generation of Jesus’ death and resurrection the identical story appears in several sources.

The early “demythologizers” claimed the New Testament was written after AD 150 giving enough time for a myth to develop. Now, even skeptical scholars like Bart Ehrman place the entire New Testament in the first century. If “layers” of myth developed over time there should be some evidence of the intermediary steps — but there is none, not in the manuscripts and not in the writings of the church fathers.

The style of the Gospels is not mythical. The gospels expect us to “check the facts” by giving us the names and places of real events and people, especially monarchs by whom we can date the materials. Would a mythical work masquerading as real reference actual events that could be cross-referenced?

Lastly, who invented the myth? The church was persecuted for three centuries; no one invents a myth in order to get martyred. Some martyrs “got cold feet” but no one ever claimed the whole story was a myth. For three centuries there was hardly a good reason to be a Christian, yet the "myth" persisted.

## Conclusions

So can we comfortably rest back in a soft bed of evidence and wait for opponents to fall into the trap of our reasoning? Have we sealed the case on Christ’s deity? Let’s refer back to Romans 1.

Paul clearly says…

> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

Just because we can refute their arguments and make arguments of our own doesn’t change what we talked about at the beginning of this class. People choose not to believe in God in spite of the evidence and their conscience.

However, sometimes someone, even though they despise Christianity and Christ, is honest enough to admit that they are a direct reflection of Paul’s statements in Romans 1. One such person said the following:

> The evangelists... record many incidents that mere inventors would have concealed—the competition of the apostles for high places in the Kingdom, their flight after Jesus’ arrest, Peter’s denial, the failure of Christ to work miracles in Galilee . . . his confessions of ignorance as to the future, his moments of bitterness, his despairing cry on the cross; no one reading these scenes can doubt the reality of the figure behind them. That a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality, so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood, would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the Gospels. After two centuries of Higher Criticism the outlines of the life, character, and teaching of Christ, remain reasonably clear, and constitute the most fascinating feature in the history of Western man.

This statement was made by Will Durant, a leading historian and atheist of the 20th century.
