<title>Metaphysics & Epistemology</title>

<h1>Metaphysics &amp; Epistemology</h1>

<p>Today we're going to look at two more components of effective apologetics: understanding metaphysics and epistemology. Because of the <em>huge</em> amount of material available, I'm only going to cover the most important parts in class, so please make sure to refer to the handout afterward to get more in-depth information.</p>

<h2>Key Terms</h2>

<p>Metaphysics: The branch of philosophy that inquires into the nature of existence. The study of existing things with a view to categorizing all phenomena of human experience.</p>

<p><strong>Ontology:</strong> A subcategory of metaphysics that inquires into the nature of real and unreal. Inquiry into the essential nature of things. Example: Are such things as dreams, spirits, &amp; ethical persuasions real?</p>

<p><strong>Cosmology:</strong> A subcategory of metaphysics that investigates the origin and process of existing things. The study of cause and effect relationships.</p>

<p><strong>Naturalism:</strong> The belief that no reality exists apart from the material, physical world. A denial of the existence of supernaturalism.</p>

<p><strong>Pantheism:</strong> The belief that god and the universe are identical. The belief that god has no personal attributes, but is identical with the material world.</p>

<h2>Metaphysics</h2>

<p>Let’s think metaphysically… Have you ever asked yourself the simple questions, “why is what is, is?” “why does anything at all exist?” I’m not referring to notions of change or development of existing things. But why do existing things exist?</p>

<p>Assess the following statements by Francis Schaeffer in <em>He is there, and He is not Silent</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you get done with any basic question there are not many people in the room.... There are not many basic answers to any of the great questions of life.</p>

<p>No one has said it better than Jean-Paul Sartre, who has said that the basic philosophical question is that something is there rather than that nothing is there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, consider the following by Gerald Schroeder in <em>The Hidden Face of God</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is there existence, even of empty space, Even of time? The basic enigma is not whether or not we evolved from an ape, or the ages of rock. The real question is why is there being?</p></blockquote>

<h3>Why is the study of metaphysics important?</h3>

<p>Philip Johnson writes,</p>

<blockquote><p>Logic works from metaphysical assumptions, or pictures of reality, and it leads in very different directions depending on the starting point.</p></blockquote>

<p>Big Idea #3 claims that God is the ultimate fact, so let’s imagine a world in which God is not the “starting point. Now explain where morality comes from? Explain the purpose of human existence.</p>

<p>Metaphysics is increasingly unpopular today. Rebecca Baer Porteous, a former Harvard student, writes of her classroom experiences in <em>Finding God at Harvard</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Classes on human nature, morality, and society systematically eschewed metaphysical questions.... What does it really mean to be a human being? This question had been excluded a priori, dismissed as nonempirical and relative, unworthy of academic consideration.... Over time I became deeply disturbed by many of my classes.... A student who is never challenged to ask such questions, never allowed to think that there might even be true answers to such questions, may be a student radically divorced from the possibility that God exists, and that in knowing a loving God, we might find the purpose of human existence.</p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald Schroeder poses the central problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>Philosophizing about the origin of our origins, cosmic or biological, may be fascinating, but rarely does it accomplish more than raising other questions.</p></blockquote>

<p>What kind of questions would a discussion of metaphysics raise? Is secular academia “open-minded”? Or does the intellectual community refuse to look at the most basic questions of all?</p>

<h3>What is the relationship between Metaphysics, Science, and Religion?</h3>

<p>Carl Sagan was a leading (Jewish) scientist in the latter half of the twentieth century who popularized evolutionary thinking. As an astrophysicist he led a search for extraterrestrial life. He was a professor at Cornell University and also created a celebrated TV series about the universe called “Cosmos.” He also wrote a book titled Cosmos that opens with startling statement:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sagan’s view was not unique to modern science. Compare Sagan’s statement with the famous Hindu Mandukya Upanishad:</p>

<blockquote><p>OM! - This Imperishable Word is the whole of this visible universe. Its explanation is as follows: What has become, what is becoming, what will become - verily, all of this is OM.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Bible’s Explanation of Metaphysics</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Genesis 1:1 “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.”</p></li>
<li><p>Romans 4:17 “... God who gives life to the dead and calls into being that which does not exist.”</p></li>
<li><p>Psalm 148:5 “He commanded, and they were created.”</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The world as we know it consists of:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>personality</p></li>
<li><p>material</p></li>
<li><p>time</p></li>
<li><p>life</p></li>
<li><p>space</p></li>
<li><p>morality</p></li>
<li><p>knowledge</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these facets of the world can be explained by appealing to God as the ultimate fact. But the atheist rejects God as the starting point. As Steven Weinberg puts it cosmologists endorse theories because they “nicely avoid the problem of Genesis.” So what options are left if we exclude God?</p>

<h2>Three Options in Metaphysics</h2>

<h3>Option 1: No Creator</h3>

<p>“Being” originated from “nothing.” I’m not referring here to the biblical doctrine of God creating ex nihilo. I’m referring to literally “nothing” creating everything.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, some scientists have postulated this view:</p>

<p>John Gribbin:</p>

<blockquote><p>The universe could have emerged out of the quantum vacuum, which produces virtual photons out of nothing at all.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Edward Tryon:</p>

<blockquote><p>Our Universe did indeed appear from nowhere.... our Universe is simply one of those things which happen from time to time.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald Schroeder:</p>

<blockquote><p>It may take a while longer for us to discover that there is some non-thing even more fundamental than energy that forms the basis of energy, which in turn forms the basis of matter.</p>

<p>That all existence may be the expression of information, an idea, a quantum wave function, is not fantasy and it is not some flaky idea. It’s mainstream science coming from such universities as Princeton and M.I.T. There is the growing possibility that for all existence, we humans included, there’s nothing, nothing as in ‘no thing,’ there.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h4>Evaluation of Option 1:</h4>

<ol>
<li><p>What motivates scientists to draw these conclusions, and are they scientific?</p></li>
<li><p>Let’s think about “nothing.” Make sure you’re not thinking of something—not energy, not light, not particles—absolute nothingness. “Nothing” is a concept we cannot conceive of. Francis Schaeffer’s blackboard illustration is too weak. When you picture nothing you see blackness. Now erase the blackness! The dictionary cannot define nothing.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nothing: (pn) No thing; not anything Nothing: (n) Something that has no existence. But you have to have the concept of “something” in order for it not to have existence, and therefore the concept is still something, not nothing!</p></blockquote></li>
<li><p>People who adopt the first option either 1) go insane, or 2) really begin with “something” rather than “nothing.”</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Option 2: Impersonal Creator</h3>

<p>The second option is that “being” originated from some non-personal thing such as: electricity, superstrings, laws of physics, mass, energy, particles, or motion.</p>

<p>Two worldviews postulate beginning with the impersonal something.</p>

<h4>Naturalism</h4>

<p>Here are the claims of three naturalists.</p>

<p>Neill Degrasse Tyson &amp; Donald Goldsmith:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the beginning, there was physics. ‘Physics’ describes how matter, energy, space, and time behave and interact with one another.... Hence everything fundamental and familiar to us earthlings begins with, and rests upon, the laws of physics.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Gerald Schroeder:</p>

<blockquote><p>What all of these conjectures have in common is that something,... an eternal whatever, predates our universe. This whatever-it-is has no bodily parts, is totally nonmaterial, is eternal, and though being absolutely nothing physically has the infinite potential to produce vast universes. Sounds familiar. Kind of like the biblical description of God. In fact it is the biblical description of God with one significant difference. A ‘potential field’ doesn’t give a hoot about the universes it spins off.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Joel Primack &amp; Nancy Abrams:</p>

<blockquote><p>In modern cosmology, there is similarly a mysterious eternal something that may have been everywhere before the Big Bang and may surround our universe forever: it is the state of being called ‘eternal inflation.’... A few theoretical cosmologists have thought a lot about what eternal inflation must be like— that is, if it exists. Their work could be wrong; no one has figured out yet how to test it.... eternal inflation, like string theory, is an ‘untested physical theory.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h4>Pantheism</h4>

<p>Eastern religions, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, are characteristically Pantheistic. Hinduism recognizes a series of gods, but these are all subsumed under a pantheistic system. Here are several claims from Taoist texts. Taoism states:</p>

<blockquote><p>There was something containing all, Before heaven and earth it exists: Tranquil, oh! Incorporeal, oh! Alone it stands and does not change. It goes everywhere and is not hindered. It can thereby become the universe’s mother. I know not its name; I characterize it by call it the Way. Forced to make a name for it I call it the Great. Great I call the elusive. The elusive I call the far. The far I call the returning.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>In the Taoist’s system (like the Naturalist’s system) life has no purpose or value because there is no Person to whom we are accountable:</p>

<blockquote><p>Existence and nonexistence are mutually produced. . . Therefore the holy man lives by making nonaction his business; He practices non-speech as his teaching. . . He gets people not to know and not to desire.... He acts by not acting. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote><p>T’ien Ken was traveling to the south of Yin mountain. He reached the river Liao when he met a nameless sage, to whom he said, ‘I beg to ask about governing the world.’ ‘Go away,’ said the nameless man, ‘you are a low fellow. How unpleasant is your question! I would be in companionship with the maker of things. When wearied, I would mount on the bird of ease and emptiness, proceed beyond the world, wander in the land of nowhere, and live in the domain of nothingness [Nirvana]. Why do you come to worry me with the problem of setting the world in order?’ <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h4>Evaluation of Option 2</h4>

<p>First, there is the problem of metaphysical tautology (a phrase or expression in which the same thing is said twice in different words). Pantheism puts the category name “god” on “what is.” It’s equivalent to saying “god” = “what is.” But how does this statement differ from the statement “what is” = “what is”? This is not an explanation but a statement. It is descriptive but not explanatory!</p>

<p>The problem of reductionism. Everything cannot be reduced to single particles. Or to say it another way, how can “some-thing” explain “every-thing.” Can everything we see in the world around us really be reduced to one basic “something.” For example modern science has never been able to explain “life.” What is the difference between the bodies of two twins, one who died two seconds ago, and the other who is still living? Physically, they are identical, but life is something more than physicality.</p>

<p>The problem of non-material properties. The impersonal something cannot account for intangible concepts such as morality, personality, life, space, thought, &amp; communication. These are not “something” but they are nevertheless real. Concepts such as right or wrong, justice or tolerance, fear and sorrow all of which are inherent in men as moral creatures cannot be explained by beginning with the impersonal something.</p>

<h3>Option 3: Personal Creator</h3>

<p>There exists only one more option. A Personal Being is the ultimate fact behind every other fact. The Bible simply begins with the only option that’s available. People often ask why the Bible doesn’t defend itself. But if there are no other answers, we do not need to defend the only possibility! In other words, the Bible rests on the presupposition that it is true, which is reasonable since we have determined the impossibility of the other two options: no creator, or an impersonal creator.</p>

<h2>Answering an Atheist’s Objection</h2>

<h3>Where did God come from?</h3>

<p>The question the atheist inevitably raises is, “so you say God is the only explanation, but where did He come from?” Richard Dawkins writes in <em>The God Delusion</em>, that chapter four “has contained the central argument of my book.” Read the following argument and note that Dawkins acknowledges the need to explain existence, but disagrees that “God” is a plausible answer. Referring to a conference at Cambridge he writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Time and again, my theologian friends returned to the point that there had to be a reason why there is something rather than nothing. There must have been a first cause of everything, and we might as well give it the name God. Yes, I said, but it must have been simple and therefore, whatever else we call it, God is not an appropriate name (unless we very explicitly divest it of all the baggage that the word ‘God’ carries in the minds of most religious believers). The first cause that we seek must have been the simple basis for a self-bootstrapping crane which eventually raised the world as we know it into its present complex existence. To suggest that the original prime mover was complicated enough to indulge in intelligent design, to say nothing of mindreading millions of humans simultaneously, is tantamount to dealing yourself a perfect hand at bridge. Look around at the world of life, at the Amazon rainforest with its rich interlacement of lianas, bromeliads, roots and flying buttresses; its army ants and it jaguars, its tapirs and peccaries, treefrogs and parrots. What you are looking at is the statistical equivalent of a perfect hand of cards....</p>

<p>To suggest that the first cause, the great unknown which is responsible for something existing rather than nothing, is capable of designing the universe and of talking to a million people simultaneously, is a total abdication of the responsibility to find an explanation....</p>

<p>Natural selection is a better alternative. Indeed, design is not a real alternative at all because it raises and even bigger problem than it solves: who designed the designer?... Any entity capable of intelligently designing something as improbable as a Dutchman’s Pipe (or a universe) would have to be even more improbable than a Dutchman’s Pipe. Far from terminating the vicious regress, God aggravates it with a vengeance.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" rel="footnote">10</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Let's summarize Dawkin's statements:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>We need to explain why the universe is there.</p></li>
<li><p>Dawkins does not know why the universe is there.</p></li>
<li><p>The universe must come from something simple rather than something complex.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Dawkins assumes an evolutionary process from simple to complex—but without giving scientific evidence. He argues that natural selection—from simple to complex—is the best solution to explain the complexity of the universe.</p>

<h4>Answering Dawkins</h4>

<p>Dawkins identifies options 2 &amp; 3 as the only real alternatives. Dawkins presupposes the first cause is an “impersonal something” – but he admits he has a problem. Interestingly, Dawkins admits his presupposition has a problem — he cannot explain the origin of non-material properties especially the origin of life.</p>

<p>He later makes a startling admission:</p>

<blockquote><p>The origin of life is a flourishing, if speculative, subject for research. The expertise required for it is chemistry and is not mine. I watch from the sidelines with engaged curiosity.... We can make the point that, however improbable the origin of life might be, we know it happened on Earth because we are here.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">11</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a surprising evasion since Dawkins is a biologist! Dawkin’s friend and fellow atheist Daniel Dennett inadvertently suggests where these kind of evasions end up.</p>

<blockquote><p>An indefensible mutual presumption can be kept aloft for years or even centuries because each person assumes that somebody else has some very good reasons for maintaining it, and nobody dares challenge it.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">12</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Ironically, “God” is the perfect answer to Dawkin’s definition of a “simple solution.” Theologians today speak of God’s “unity” by which they mean He is not composed of multiple parts. Theologians used to use the term “simplicity” to refer to God’s unity — simple in the sense of a non-complexity of parts. This secondary use of the term reflects who God is in His essence; He is pure Spirit with no interworking parts. An all-powerful simple first cause satisfies Dawkin’s requirements quite nicely.</p>

<p>Dawkins falsely ascribes creature categories to God. God, by definition, exists in His own category and does not need the same kind of explanation that finite beings need. All finite things require a definite point of origin. Infinite beings do not.</p>

<blockquote><p>The question ‘If God made everything, who made God?’ is like asking ‘Who made circles square?’ It assumes a self-contradiction: that the uncreated Creator is a created creature. It extends the law about changing things—that every change needs a cause—beyond its limits, to the unchanging Source of change. God does not need a cause, or a maker, because he is not made or changed. He changes other things, but is not himself changed by anything. There is nothing that comes to be in him, nothing that needs a cause for its coming-into-being.<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" rel="footnote">13</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>There are two, and only two, kinds of “reality.”</p>

<blockquote><p>There is the reality that is the triune God himself, and there is the reality that is everything else.... Everything within the experience of the creature (centrally, people). . . is fundamentally and essentially, immutably and invariably, creaturely. That is, creatures think as creatures, know as creatures, exist as creatures, and so forth. God, on the other hand, has nothing essentially creaturely about him. He exists as a non-creature, thinks as a non-creature, knows as a non-creature, and so on.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">14</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Medieval theologians argued that there is a necessary link between God’s infinity and the existence of anything. The Latin phrase ex nihilo nihil fit means “Out of nothing, nothing comes.” It requires an infinite power to produce the infinite change from nonbeing to being. This is so because the ability to originate anything necessarily implies entire mastery of that thing, irrespective of its size. To bring a universe into existence can therefore only be accomplished by One who has mastery of that universe in its entirety. Any such being, by definition, is all powerful—He is authoritative over “all things.” Consequently, if anything exists, there is infinite authority; that is, something other than finiteness is required for finite things to exist.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: It is impossible to prove that God does not exist.</h2>

<p>Although numerous scientists have tried to prove God does not exist, this is a claim impossible of proof. Since God is not a creature, He cannot be investigated in the same way we investigate all other created things. Some scientists have been honest enough to admit this truth.</p>

<p>Stephen J. Gould, the most famous recent American advocate of evolution, an atheist and longtime professor at Harvard writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>To say it for all my colleagues and for the umpteenth million time: science simply cannot (by its legitimate methods) adjudicate the issue of God’s possible superintendence of nature. We neither affirm nor deny it; we simply can’t comment on it as scientists. If some of our crowd have made untoward statements claiming that Darwinism disproves God, then I will find Mrs. McInerney [Gould’s third grade teacher] and have their knuckles rapped for it.... Science can work only with naturalistic explanations; it can neither affirm nor deny other types of actors (like God) in other spheres (the moral realm, for example).<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" rel="footnote">15</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Robert Jastrow, an agnostic, an internationally known astronomer, founder of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and Professor of Astronomy and Geology at Columbia University, writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Universe had, in some sense, a beginning—that it began at a certain moment of time, and under circumstances that seem to make it impossible—not just now, but ever—to find out what force of forces brought the world into being at that moment. Was it, as the Bible says, that “Thou, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thine hands?” No scientist can answer that question; we can never tell whether the Prime Mover willed the world into being.<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">16</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>To categorically deny God’s existence is a deliberate act of the will, one which we see outlined in Romans 1, which we reviewed last time under the lens of presupposition and evidence.</p>

<h2>Epistemology</h2>

<p>Now let's turn our focus to the second element I want to study this week: epistemology. How do we know what we know? To summarize, there are five basic sources of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Revelation</h3>

<p>Revelation presupposes that all truth has its source in God. Revelation presupposes the existence of God and His ability to communicate knowledge to man. The great questions of the universe, of our existence and of our purpose in life, and of our destiny are revealed to us in simple propositional statements — they are communicated in ordinary human language.</p>

<p>The Scriptures teach that there are two forms of Revelation. Psalms 19 says:</p>

<blockquote><p>The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard.... The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</p></blockquote>

<p>God communicates directly through special revelation. But nature is also a source of communication.</p>

<p>What tools are necessary to read General Revelation? Some Christians reject the use of human reason and experience as means of knowledge. But if Scripture has invited us to investigate nature, why would we reject to tools God gives us to investigate?</p>

<h3>Rationalism</h3>

<p>Rationalism builds on intuition and deduction. By intuition we know that the number five is greater than the number four. By deduction we reason syllogistically. Rationalists believe there are things we simply intuit—we know independently of experience. Mathematics is often said to be intuitive. We have never experienced a perfect triangle, but we have the concept nevertheless. The Declaration of Independence declares that some truths are “self-evident.”</p>

<p>Plato believed in truths that were derived solely through intuition, independent of actual experience. His “theory of forms” posited that nonmaterial essences existed in the unchanging intelligible world. For instance, we have the category of “tree” in our minds. No two of us have the identical image; no two trees are alike. But the tree “form” guarantees that when you or I think three, we are not thinking car, or pig, or lamp. Whatever the form of tree is, it is not detectable by the senses. The senses perceive particular things (an actual tree), but not the form in itself.</p>

<p>Plato’s theory of forms is especially relevant to rationalism in mathematics.</p>

<blockquote><p>For example, the number 2 must exist, or else there couldn’t be two apples, two oranges, two horses. Triangleness must be real, or else equilateral, acute, and obtuse three sided polygons would not be in the same category. Yet no one has ever seen the number 2 or triangleness.[^fn-stumpf_able]</p></blockquote>

<p>René Descartes represents the epitome of rationalistic thought. In a justly famous thought experiment, he purged his mind of all memories and sensory data. He then asked:</p>

<blockquote><p>Does it now follow that I too do not exist? No; if I conceived myself of something, then I certainly existed. . . . I must finally conclude that this proposition, I am, I exist, is necessarily true whenever it is put forward by me or conceived in my mind.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">17</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Beginning from the interior world of his own existence, Descartes attempted to reconstruct the outer world through reason. He began with God. Because he had an intuitive impression in his mind that God existed, and because every effect (the idea of God) must have a cause, God was the only sufficient cause of the effect; therefore God existed. Although Descartes used reason to conclude God existed, the majority of rationalists have used reason as a substitute for Revelation.</p>

<p>Is rationalism circular? Can you prove that rationalism is legitimate apart from reason?</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason, the center of the Enlightenment, is but one of the evolved, fully human means we use to live our lives. Reason itself has finally led us to see the inadequacy of reason.<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" rel="footnote">18</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<h3>Empiricism</h3>

<p>All knowledge derives from sense experience. Knowledge is a posteriori.</p>

<p>Empiricists presuppose that truth or “real facts” are simply “out there.” They are discovered “inductively” through the scientific method—or through sensory input. David Hume represents the epitome of empirical thought.</p>

<blockquote><p>Were any object presented to us, and were we required to pronounce concerning the effect which will result from it, without consulting past observation; after what manner, I beseech you, must the mind proceed in this operation?<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" rel="footnote">19</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>The Persian philosopher Ibn Sina, also know as Avicenna, proposed the famous empirical tabula rasa theory in the eleventh century. Sina believed the human brain at birth was a “blank slate” because there were as yet, no sensory impressions on the mind.</p>

<p>The Scottish philosopher David Hume is widely recognized as the greatest of the empiricists. Hume denied the legitimacy of cause and effect relationships.</p>

<blockquote><p>This proposition that causes and effects are discoverable, not by reason but by experience will readily be admitted with regard to such objects as we remember to have once been altogether unknown to us; since we must be conscious of the utter inability which we then lay under, of foretelling what would arise from them.... Nor does any man imagine that the explosion of gunpowder, or the attraction of a lodestone, could ever be discovered by arguments a priori.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" rel="footnote">20</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Even mathematics, according to Hume, depends upon the relationship of real things.</p>

<p>Hume became most famous, not merely for his skepticism of cause and effect relationships, but his skepticism of miracles. Many regard his argument against miracles (which will be analyzed later in the course) to be the final word on the subject.</p>

<h3>Tradition</h3>

<p>How much of what you know derives from your own scientific experiments, your own reasoning, etc. How much of what you know about Revelation truly came directly to you through the mediation of the Word by the Spirit?</p>

<h3>Synthetic</h3>

<p>Many philosophers have presented synthetic approaches that combine elements of rationalism and empiricism. Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason produces such a synthesis.</p>

<p>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the <em>New Essays on Human Understanding</em> also argues for a synthetic approach:</p>

<blockquote><p>The senses, although they are necessary for all our actual knowledge, are not sufficient to give us the whole of it, since the senses never give anything but instances, that is to say particular or individual truths. Now all the instances which confirm a general truth, however numerous they may be, are not sufficient to establish the universal necessity of this same truth, for it does not follow that what happened before will happen in the same way again. . . . From which it appears that necessary truths, such as we find in pure mathematics, and particularly in arithmetic and geometry, must have principles whose proof does not depend on instances, nor consequently on the testimony of the senses, although without the senses it would never have occurred to us to think of them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Defining Christian Epistemology: We are accustomed to thinking of Christianity as narrow. And in an ethical sense this is true, but epistemologically Christianity is broad. It embraces all four epistemic sources: revelation, reason, empiricism, and tradition. It does not embrace them equally, however. The latter three are subordinate to the claims of revelation. This functional subordination does not limit reason, or experience, or tradition, it orients it and gives it true direction. It ultimately encourages a bountiful use of all three subordinate sources in a way that no other worldview can. Enlightenment epistemologies are reductionistic. They reduce man to a rationalistic machine, or to a sensory driven animal. False religions (even those that claim Revelation as an epistemic source) inevitably proscribe human rationality, experience or tradition. They do not subject themselves to archeological or scientific verification. They demand blind obedience. Christian epistemology is the broadest conceivable.</p>

<h2>Summary of Western Epistemological Positions</h2>

<p>The following three positions can be illustrated using a clock. William Paley—an 18 th c. British apologist and theist offered a famous illustration of finding a clock on a heath. If you stumbled across one, you would conclude that there must be a watchmaker. It could not have gotten there by accident. Paley believed God constructed the world in its entirety, but He went on to operate within the world—the clock maker could “tinker” with His creation at any time He pleased. He may also need to do radical repair work once man ruins His clock.</p>

<p>The clock has also been used to depict a deistic conception of God. God made it, wound it up, and it’s been running on its own ever since. God made the world, created natural laws by which the world operates, and it’s been running on its own ever since. God does not get involved. In fact, he’s like a grand old clock maker up in heaven with flowing white hair and a long beard who fell asleep a long time ago, since everything goes along fine without Him.</p>

<p>Richard Dawkins in the <em>Blind Watchmaker</em> literally claims that nature created itself. The clock has self-assembled; no watchmaker is needed. (His arguments are hardly convincing and surprisingly unscientific.)</p>

<h3>Theism</h3>

<p>God spoke man &amp; creation into existence by a creative act of His will. Theism emphasizes God’s transcendence. He exists before, and outside of His creation. His existence is not contingent upon the universe. Theism equally emphasizes God’s immanence. God is active within His creation through providence and miracles (including the incarnation.)</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages and the Reformation period, Theists understood that Revelation was the foundation of knowledge. But reason and experience were also legitimate tools for understanding. A triangular scheme with Revelation at the top prevailed. Theistic epistemology is built on Revelation, Reason, &amp; Empiricism. But the latter two are functionally subordinate.</p>

<h3>Deism</h3>

<p>God initiated natural history and allows it to follow its natural course. Deism emphasizes God’s transcendence; He is completely detached from the universe He made. Deism eliminates God’s immanence; He does not intervene in human affairs through providence, miracles, or the incarnation.</p>

<p>During the Enlightenment, western thinkers abandoned Revelation and substituted either empiricism or rationalism in its place. Knowledge was reduced to one of these two foci. Deistic epistemology is built on Reason &amp; Empiricism and often reduces ultimately to one of these two foci—both of which are ultimately circular.</p>

<h3>Naturalism</h3>

<p>God does not exist. Naturalism erases both God’s transcendence and God’s immanence. If God does not exist (i.e. non-physical thinking, emotional, willful Person) what else might not exists? What about man’s soul, the immaterial part of man, his mind? Naturalism, logically pursued, becomes deterministic in its epistemology. Because there is no metaphysical aspect to man, all that it left is the random firing of neurons.</p>

<p>Naturalistic epistemology attempts to retain Reason &amp; Empiricism but ultimately becomes either nihilistic (most postmodernists are nihilistic) or deterministic. Richard Rorty, one of the great postmodern thinkers, writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>The idea that one species of organism is, unlike all the others, oriented not just toward its own increased prosperity but toward Truth, is as un- Darwinian as the idea that every human being has a built-in moral compass.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" rel="footnote">21</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard psychologist, demonstrates that epistemology ultimately becomes deterministic in the naturalist’s understanding.</p>

<blockquote><p>The self. . . is just another network of brain systems. . . . The evidence is overwhelming that every aspect of our mental lives depends entirely on physiological events in the tissues of the brain.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" rel="footnote">22</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>In the both the postmodernist and naturalist conception of epistemology there is neither justification for pursuing knowledge, nor reason to accept that our reasoning or experiences have ever delivered accurate information.</p>

<h2>Biblical Epistemology</h2>

<p>Does the Bible’s redemption narrative, centered on the cross of Christ, have anything to do with how I think about the world around me? There is no better passage for addressing these questions than 1 Corinthians 1-2, where we find the word “wisdom” or “wise” used twenty times. This is the New Testament’s most concentrated discussion of wisdom.</p>

<h3>Historical Setting</h3>

<p>1 Corinthians 1-2 presents a detailed analysis of Christian epistemology. There are two contexts to consider when analyzing this passage.</p>

<p>First, Paul is addressing the most carnal New Testament church, but also (perhaps) the most gifted church. There were numerous divisions in the church, and many evinced a particular affinity for certain preachers. “Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.” To the immature believers at Corinth, Peter and Apollos were celebrities. Peter was the eyewitness, he had experienced Christ—he appealed to the empiricists. Apollos was the great orator, powerful in speech and presentation—he appealed to the rationalists.</p>

<p>Second, Paul (on his second missionary journey) traveled from Athens to Corinth. He had been hounded by the Judaizers since he first set foot in Europe. They were vicious, sought to destroy his ministry and put him to death. Not till he came to Athens, does he finally shake them off his trail. But in Athens he finds a new problem, the Greeks, the philosophers. They hear him out on Mars Hill until he introduces the resurrection—but they’ll hear none of that. Paul is largely unsuccessful, and we do not read of him founding a church in Athens as he does elsewhere in Greece. These experiences, consequently, shaped his further missionary endeavors. Listen to him describe how he came to Corinth from Athens, 1 Corinthians 2:1 says:</p>

<blockquote><p>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Analyzing the Passage</h3>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:17</p>

<blockquote><p>For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</p></blockquote>

<p>What is the gospel? Verse 18 gives the answer.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:18</p>

<blockquote><p>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Gospel is the preaching of the cross, but this is deliberately offensive to human pride. In fact we must be cautious about over intellectualism.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:19</p>

<blockquote><p>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</p></blockquote>

<p>God declares that He is going to do something radical—He will destroy human wisdom. How will He accomplish this? The answer comes both in verse 18, and verse 21 to follow. Preaching the gospel has a destructive force on our intellectualism.</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:20</p>

<blockquote><p>Where is the wise? where is the scribe [scholar; Legal scholar]? where is the disputer [debator/philosopher] of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p></blockquote>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:21</p>

<blockquote><p>For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</p></blockquote>

<p>God deliberately crafted a plan of salvation that was unknowable through the vanity of man’s own reasoning. Not that men don’t know God (Romans 1), but they can’t understand the story of redemption without being humble enough to accept what appears to them to be “foolish preaching.” God’s means of salvation, appears ridiculous to the intellectual. There is nevertheless a brilliance to God message, because it is one that children can understand while first class intellectuals can’t seem to get it? Why is this?</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 1:22-23</p>

<blockquote><p>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;</p></blockquote>

<p>The Jews are obsessed with empiricism—give us the sign. The Greeks were in love with their own wisdom—give us philosophy. We all have this tendency to ground our beliefs either in the empirical/experience, or philosophy and argumentation. Even for the Christian, there is the tendency to ground Christianity in charismatic gifts on the one hand or rationalistic apologetics on the other. Review the contrast between Hume and Descartes that culminates in Jean Francois Lyotard’s “Incredulity toward Metanarratives.”</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 2:9</p>

<blockquote><p>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing in the context either of 1 Cor. 2 or Isa. 64 suggests that Paul is speaking here of heavenly realities. Rather he is speaking of the fact that God reveals things to believers that are beyond the limits of finite comprehension acquisition. “Eye hath not seen”—referring to the empirical; “entering into the heart” [verse 10 indicates that in the present “God hath revealed” (an accomplished fact with ongoing ramifications) these things to us.]</p>

<p>So how do we understand these things? Verses 10-16 give the answer; six times the Spirit Himself is said to give us understanding. Paul will contrast the understanding of the natural man with the spiritual man. Simply put, there are things that the natural man can never know. But we know them, and the best part? Verse 12 tells us its “free”</p>

<p>1 Corinthians 2:10-14</p>

<blockquote><p>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Epistemology &amp; Worldview</h2>

<p>There are two primary questions we need to ask:</p>

<p>Do Christians not place any value on empiricism and reason? If not, why would the Bible ever point us to general revelation?</p>

<p>Proverbs 6:6</p>

<blockquote><p>Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and</p></blockquote>

<p>be wise</p>

<p>Isaiah 1:18</p>

<blockquote><p>Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD:</p></blockquote>

<p>though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;</p>

<p>though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>

<p>How do we account for unbelievers that are clearly very educated? There certainly is no doubt that an unbeliever’s empirical or rational powers may far surpass my own. There is no doubt that when we speak of knowledge strictly in terms of information, the unbeliever may know far more than I do. But his problem irrespective of his discipline, will always be the same; he cannot create a narrative that sufficiently bundles all his information together in a coherent and sufficiently explanatory worldview like I can.</p>

<h3>Case Study: Stephen Hawking’s Universe</h3>

<p>In his bestselling <em>A Brief History of Time</em>¸ world-famous scientist Stephen Hawking states our dilemma as finite human beings. He writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>We find ourselves in a bewildering world. We want to make sense of what we see around us and to ask: What is the nature of the universe? What is our place in it and where did it and we come from? Why is it the way it is?...</p>

<p>To try to answer these questions we adopt some “world picture.” Just as an infinite tower of tortoises supporting the flat earth is such a picture, so is the theory of superstrings. Both are theories of the universe.... Both... lack observational evidence: no one has ever seen a giant tortoise with the earth on its back, but then, no one has seen a superstring either....</p>

<p>However, if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable in broad principle by everyone, not just a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason—for then we would know the mind of God.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" rel="footnote">23</a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Now notice how Paul concludes His epistemological discussion in 1 Corinthians 2:16</p>

<blockquote><p>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? but we have the mind of Christ.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Case Study: Antony Flew</h3>

<p>Antony Flew was a long time philosopher and champion of atheism. He was as respected as much as any philosopher in the atheist community, until he announced in 2004 that he had changed his mind. He was prepared, after long exposure to the design argument and DNA evidence, that there was a Designer after all. However, Flew has not accepted the concept of an afterlife, nor Jesus Christ as His personal Savior. Flew is a deist.</p>

<p>In 2007 Flew published a memoir explaining his decision to change his mind. His final chapter is called “Open to Omnipotence.” Flew explains that he is willing to learn more about the Designer of the universe. He also clues the reader in to the sources of his knowledge.</p>

<blockquote><p>I must say again that the journey to my discovery of the Divine has thus far been a pilgrimage of reason. I have followed the argument where it has led me.... I am entirely open to learning more about the Divine Reality.... The question of whether the Divine has revealed itself in human history remains a valid topic of discussion.... No other religion enjoys anything like the combination of a charismatic figure like Jesus and a first-class intellectual like St. Paul. If you’re wanting omnipotence to set up a religion, it seems to me that this is the one to beat<img src="" title="Antony Flew, *There is a God: How the World’s Most Notorious Atheist Changed his Mind*(New York: HarperOne, 2007), 156-7." alt="^fn-notorious" /></p></blockquote>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Our creator is revealed through all means of knowing. He has revealed himself in Scripture, we can, and have, reasonably concluded he is the only possible explanation for the universe, we can empirically observe his handiwork, and we know from history and tradition of his work. The Bible is the most open-minded religion in the world! We have access to all forms of knowledge, and all of them support our position.</p>

<p>The Bible's explanation of origins and openness to epistemological examination makes it the most sound resting place for our faith, although ultimately we must realize that it is still faith, because we have not yet seen God.</p>
