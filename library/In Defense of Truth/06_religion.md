In our discussion of apologetics we need to tackle the issue of religion in general. What is it, how did it come about, and how does that affect everyday people? Why are there so many if there really is only one "right" one?

Something that seems very obvious to us is actually under a great deal of debate in the secular world. We tend to not think about religion a great deal, in the sense of what it is, since for most of us it’s simply a part of life. You don’t probably think about the origin of your food or even a lot of times what’s in it, simply because you’re used to it being that way.

## Reviewing the Big Ideas

1. Identical evidence can lead to different conclusions based upon one's presuppositions

2. The world consistently and comprehensively makes sense only when interpreted through the narrative presented by Scripture

3. God is the ultimate fact that explains every other fact

## Key Terms

1. Mana: spiritual energy that one can possess or obtain through different actions

2. Animism: belief that spirits inhabit both living & non-living objects

3. Polytheism: belief in and worship of multiple gods

4. Henotheism: belief in multiple gods but worship of one

5. Monotheism: belief in and worship of only one god

## What is Religion?

So what exactly is religion? That’s probably not something you think about too often. Not what is Christianity, or Islam, but what is religion in the broader sense?

Religion tends to show certain characteristics regardless of culture, so let’s talk about a few of them.

1. A religion is centered on a being, or beings that are more powerful than humans

2. Because of their power, wisdom, or other qualities, these beings are shown great respect

3. This respect is shown through prayers, sacrifices, and rituals

4. A distinction between the secular and the sacred (special rules for priests, religious holidays, etc)

5. Often social groups form based on the religions present

Religion is a universal phenomena in all cultures, despite the efforts of both governments and individuals all over the world. We have yet to discover a culture that does not have the characteristics of religion present. This presents challenges for those who reject religion because they're forced to explain why every single culture, no matter how advanced, has followed this same path.

## Where Did Religion Come From?

Although most of us are at least superficially familiar with the origin of our religion, for our purpose of becoming better apologists for the faith it’s important for us to analyze the origin of other religions as well to better understand their perspective.

We know from Scripture that Christianity makes absolute claims about being the only true religion. What references make that claim? We see in John 14:6:

> Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.

So if we know from the authority of Scripture, as well as our own study that we’ve done - think back to our Big Ideas and our discussion on the necessity of a personal creator in the fourth lesson - that we hold the correct position, how do we view the origins of other religions? We’re going to get to that, but first we’re going to look at two secular views prior to our own.

### Three Theories

1. Evolutionary: religions were created to explain natural events and became increasingly complex

2. Subjective: religion was a psychological response to subconsious impulses

3. Original Monotheism: all religions originated from a monotheistic belief system and degenerated into the various forms we see today

The evolutionary perspective is an extension of biological evolutionary theory into the realm of philosophy. Basically, religion was created in order to help explain natural events that we see around us. As time went on these explanations became more and more complex and creative, but now a point has been reached when they are no longer necessary.

There are two basic perspectives that we will analyze later. Some evolutionists claim we are even on the thought level simply acting out programming from our genes, and that religion is simply an error in our genetics that needs to be overcome or corrected. Others claim that it’s an expression of human creativity, which is perhaps even more difficult to explain.

The subjective perspective is probably best known as the one championed by Freud. It makes no attempt to explain the actual historical progress of religion (although evolutionary development is tacitly implied). The claim is that religion was a psychological response to subconscious impulses. In other words, we created religion to help deal with certain elements of our psyche in order to live more harmoniously. Whereas the evolutionary perspective simply naturalizes religion against the backdrop of survival, subjectivism sees religion as “hope”.

Finally the position supported by the Bible is that of Original Monotheism. This is the view that all religions devolved from a belief in one god. We’ll take a look at scriptural supports as well as secular supports in a little while. Note that this isn’t specifically a Christian view, but it’s the one supported by Scripture. In other words, there are unbelievers who also support it.

### Evolutionary

So let’s take a closer look at the Evolutionary theory of religion. And remember that the purpose here is not to validate alternative views, but to analyze them in the light of Scripture, reason, and experience. You’re going to meet people who hold to one of the two alternative positions, and although most people can’t articulate their beliefs to the level that we’re going to, we can’t go into apologetics aiming low.

So that being said, what is the evolutionary position?

Basically, they accept biological evolution as a fact and a presupposition upon which to base all other reasoning.

Since man has become more intellectually complex over time, his religions must have also. And on the other hand, the farther back we go the simpler they will be. This reasoning is also applied to other fields such as politics and philosophy (each one is more perfect than the last), which brings up some interesting questions that we may be able to cover at the end of the class.

Evolutionary theory proposes that religion came from one of two sources.

First, man was simply expressing creativity and made up narratives to explain natural phenomena (such as lightning) since he had no way of knowing what it actually was. Much as people couldn’t fathom the presence of a tiny little man inside the box in their living room, early man couldn’t understand events around him and invented explanations to get it off his mind. Arthur C. Clarke summed it up well when he said:

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

How many of you would yell something about demons or dark magic if you suddenly saw me start to levitate? Basically their premise is that demons, magic, and gods were created by humans to explain the unexplainable.

Alternatively, man is simply hardwired to believe in some sort of superior being/force simply because of a few misaligned genes that haven’t been eliminated by natural selection yet. Our response to religion is similar to that of a moth to a candle: we’re simply misguided because our programming is slightly off so that we tend to try and explain natural events supernaturally.

It also proposes the following six stages of religion:

1. Mana
2. Animism
3. Polytheism
4. Henotheism
5. Monotheism
6. Post-theism

What are some critiques of this position?

First, it has never actually been observed in action. No one has witnessed a transition in a culture's religion along this path, and in fact all of the first five "stages" can be observed presently. The sixth stage is - I would argue - still anomalous and has never been observed to occur "naturally." By that I mean that we've never observed a culture or an individual who innately lacked any sense of a higher power. This ties right into Romans 1:21 which says:

> Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.

It's explicitly based on the idea that simple things grow more and more complex, which is a presupposition carried over from biology. The theory of evolution lacks hard evidence even in the field of biology, but has been applied to physics, religion, and many other fields in which its support is even more tenuous.

It also presupposes that there is in fact no supernatural, so all religion is just a "repackaging" of phenomenon that can be explained naturally. Most interestingly, there are important questions about whether those who do not believe in God consider themselves to be the next "stage" of human evolution, which raises red flags about how religious individuals will be viewed in the future. Any view that reduces human behavior to simple determinism sets the stage for racism, but without classifying a belief in God as a genetic "defect" there is no reasonable explanation for why it persists.

### Subjective

The subjective view, as mentioned, is psychological in nature and seeks to analyze the subconscious motives behind religion. However, it’s based on the evolutionary model, and thus inherits its weaknesses. It’s not as “in fashion” as it used to be since it’s not explicitly naturalistic.

According to Freud, a group of young men got tired of the oldest man (at least some of them were his descendants) “hoarding” all the women in their tribe and teamed up to kill him and steal his wives. After killing him they suddenly realized that they had made a mistake, and out of guilt they decided to honor him by holding a feast at which they consumed his corpse. From this event religion gradually grew as they passed on this tradition to their descendants, and over time he was ascribed supernatural qualities and idealized as the “perfect” being. This is also where taboos such as incest and murder came from, and the practice of sacrificing to a deity.

Other members of this camp propose that all religion is basically a form of self-worship where we take the things we like best about ourselves and project them onto one being. It’s sort of a “human race” propaganda. Some view atheism as a positive result in this light, since we’ve moved beyond projecting our self-image onto an imaginary being and instead directly worship ourselves.

What are some weaknesses of this position, other than the ones inherited from evolutionary theory?

It is completely conjectural, and also relies on the concept of morality. What would have led these individuals to feel remorse in the first place? Why were such feelings triggered by his death? This theory cannot be tested, and at most is a curiousity - even in the secular arena - at this point.

### Original Monotheism

First, most of us wouldn’t know how to explain this position if confronted, so we’ll look at the thinking behind it.

Secondly we’re going to look at the evidence and supports both within and outside of Scripture that confirm this position as superior to the two alternatives.

Third, keep in mind that this argument is strongly linked to the Personal Creator presupposition and that you may first need to walk someone (including yourself) through the reasoning and evidence that demonstrates its superiority.

Original monotheism as we mentioned supposes that all existing religions are in fact derived from monotheism. In fact, the process is exactly the opposite from the evolutionary model. Religions have not grown more sophisticated, but have degenerated into polytheism, animism, etc.

This position is supported by several observations. For instance, religion is indeed universal in existence, but also shares many common qualities. For instance, in no culture is cold murder accepted as a positive social activity. The example has been given that no one would be exonerated if he killed a man who just gave him water in the middle of the desert. The vast majority of cultures have prohibitions against incest, adultery (although they may define marriage more broadly), theft, etc.

As we noted, the evolutionary model (the only real alternative presented) hasn’t actually been observed occurring anywhere at all. Research in fact shows that most religions not only feature some sort of “over-god” (if they are polytheistic or animistic) but also share common attributes and narrative characteristics with the Biblical description of God. While this isn’t evidential proof since we were unable to observe the origin of each religion, it is in some ways a “smoking gun” that alludes to a common origin.

Wilhelm Schmidt, a Catholic anthropologist, notes that instead of extremely primitive religions, the most simple civilizations actually reference one supreme god in the sky who they indicate created everything. This god is almost always referred to as male and provides standards of behavior which must be obeyed. Also, he notes that at some point in most cultural narratives the god became more distant because of their disobedience.

Historical records, such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead, indicate original belief in one god. But most importantly, this position is supported by Scripture.

Romans 1:18-25 states:

> For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse: Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.

> Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.

In Acts 17:22-28 Paul preaches to the philosophers of Athens:

> Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars' hill, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To The Unknown God. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you. God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands; Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation; That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us: For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.

## Conclusions

Of the three theories, the only two that aren't tripped up right out of the gate are the evolutionary theory and original monotheism, and of the two original monotheism actually has more support even outside of scripture. However, we know from Romans that this is clearly the path that human religions are bound to take, devolving from monotheism to the worship of many gods, nature, and ourselves.

Points that should be brought to the attention of those pushing the evolutionary theory are that it's based on a presupposition that things grow more complex, and that it's also based on the presupposition that there is no supernatural. Both presuppositions are further rooted in the worldview of an impersonal creative force, which we've analyzed before. You should try to walk people through the problems with that worldview, because all of those weaknesses are inherited by the evolutionary view of religion. I would challenge such a person to explain where a genetic theory of religion leads, and what they would do about individuals with lingering defects such as a belief in God.

Ultimately, we see that the strongest support again lies with original monotheism, which fits into a personal creative being behind the universe. That this being would make himself known to his creation isn't surprising, and neither is a desire for a relationship with his creation.
