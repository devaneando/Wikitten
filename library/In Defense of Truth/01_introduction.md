Here are the [PowerPoint slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/hp20m1b8wktuzp3/Week%20One%20-%20Introduction.pptx) from this week's class.

# What is apologetics?

In one sentence, what is Apologetics?

> Apologetics is speaking (or writing) in defense of something.

Not strictly a Christian concept, you could technically be an apologist for a boy band if you wanted.

## Apologetics is...

Let's take a look at that more deeply. If apologists are defending, does that mean that we're defensive? Is there a difference? What's the difference between defending something and being defensive in our everyday language?

So what is the essence of defensiveness in our thinking? Basically nervous, insecure, and cornered. Contrast that to what I'm about to tell you.

How many of you have seen aircraft carriers in person? Imagine being in one of the aircraft defending that aircraft carrier, surrounded by a fleet of other warships. Imagine the combined firepower of all those ships, and all the aircraft on that aircraft carrier. Now imagine that you're being confronted by another aircraft. How secure do you feel about your defenses? That's some serious power for someone on defense.

That's what it's like to be defending the Gospel. But remember, that strength doesn't come from you, it comes from the power behind you. Those two aircraft might be evenly matched, but the power behind the defender can't even be compared. All of this is very, very relevant to you. How?

**1 Peter 3:15** *But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear*

This verse is targeted at anyone whose hope is in the Lord. Is that you? Then defending that hope is relevant for you. Giving an answer implies that there is a question. Asking a question is provoking, and your response must be ready.

## Apologetics isn't...

Apologetics is not ever ugly. You are never justified in making personal attacks on someone else to defend the Gospel. Not only is it illogical (what's known as an *ad hominem*"attack on the man" approach) but it's also unbiblical and it won't get someone saved.

You must also remember that it's not an end, by which I mean, the study of apologetics isn't going to get you a crown in heaven. It's only a means to doing other things, like sharing the gospel and honing your own faith.

**Ephesians 2:8-9** *For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: not of works, lest any man should boast.*

Don't make the mistake of thinking that you can argue someone into heaven. You can't even save yourself, let alone someone else, as we're reminded by Ephesians 2:8-9. Only the power of God allows anyone to have the faith to accept salvation.

# What to bring

Now we're going to take a minute to go over what you should probably have with you each week. These will help you get the most from the class.

1. **Bible:** you need to be prepared to compare your thoughts to Scripture, as well as compare Scripture with Scripture. For instance, I need someone to tell me where this passage is located. Especially since many of you now have tablets and smartphones, this shouldn't take long.
2. **Brain:** you need to think critically and carefully about what's said. You also need to be able to think about thinking. That's called Metacognition.
3. **Notepad & Pen:** you don't need to take frantic notes, just write down important things that occur to you. Paying attention is more important than having a complete record of every single PowerPoint slide, and I've made the outlines and recordings available online.

# Introductory Terms

Let's review some terminology to kick off the class. These are some things we'll come back to again, so make sure to take note. Literally.

1. Backfire Effect
2. Presuppositions
3. Evidence

## Backfire Effect

When you debate with people, you'll often run into the [Backfire Effect](http://j.mp/backfireeffect). If you take note of the link, or just check out the notes on the website, you can read an interesting article on this phenomenon. I'm not endorsing everything this person says, so please review it critically.

Basically the more ammunition you bring to the argument, the thicker the bunker becomes.

If I tell you that your clothes are hideously out of date and that you obviously don't have any sense of fashion, how does that make you feel? Did you think "Wow, I guess I should get new clothes" or did you think "Well look who's talking"?

When you walk up to a Muslim or an atheist and tell them they're stupid for believing the things they do and that they should know better, you're asking for a negative "bunker" response. This is for better or worse human nature, although it's important to remember that this doesn't mean we shouldn't confront people with the truth. However, more important than a full arsenal of intellectual nukes is a sensitive spirit, guidance from the Holy Spirit, and a gentle attitude. Always temper your answers with kindness and meekness. Remember that Proverbs clearly instructs us that "A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger."

I'm going to steal a page from Pastor Pritt  and remind you that questions are always better than statements when confronting someone's beliefs or actions. If I thought my friend was doing something inappropriate, I might say "How do you think that action is perceived?" or "What led you to think that was the best choice" instead of "Hey, that was dumb." Likewise, when talking to someone about my faith (or theirs) I might lead off with questions and let them do most of the answering. Remember, the person asking the questions is in the position to guide the conversation, but like 1 Peter says, always be ready to give an answer.

## Presupposition

How many of you know what a *presupposition* is?

> A thing tacitly assumed beforehand at the beginning of a line of argument or course of action.

A presupposition is anything that you take for granted in order to reason something out. Logic and rational argument rely on presupposition in order to function, because they draw conclusions based on certain assumptions, which if true, make the conclusions true.

A Christian might presuppose that miracles are true before examining the possibility of Christ rising from the dead, while an athiest would presuppose the impossibility of miracles before examining the situation.


## Evidence

A term we're probably more familiar with is *evidence*.

> The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.

This is a concept we're pretty familiar with as Americans, especially when it comes to our justice system. Show me the evidence! Evidence is tied closely to empiricism, meaning that you rely on things you experience to form a position. We like to "have all the facts" before reaching a conclusion, and it's really nice when the evidence points to something we believe.

However, here's some food for thought: if we believe the Bible because the evidence points to its correctness, do we not become judges of the Word of God? If we say that we believe the Bible because all the evidence confirms it, we're placing conditions upon it, basically that we'll believe it as long as the facts stack up. Is that appropriate?

On the other hand, can we legitimately be pleased when the facts and evidence *do* point to the correctness of the Word?

## Presupposition vs. Evidence

So of the two positions, which is correct? Let's look at three different questions and analyze how we answer them and how our minds reach conclusions about them.

1. How old is the Grand Canyon?
2. Why do monkeys and humans have almost identical DNA?
3. Why do animals and humans adapt to their environments?

Sherlock Holmes comments:

> Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing… it may seem to point very straight to one thing, but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something entirely different… there is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.

Each of the answers to these questions points to to the fact that your presuppositions often lead your perception of the evidence. That leads us to Big Idea #1:

> Identical evidence can lead to different conclusions based upon one's presuppositions.

This is something that we're going to come back to in our third lesson, so be thinking about the implications of your presuppositions on the way that you perceive the world.

# Next Week: [Narratives](narratives)

Next week we are covering the idea of narratives, especially narratives that answer ultimate questions about life, origin, and the future.
