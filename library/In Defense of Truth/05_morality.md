This week we're going to dip into morality, ethics, and the problem of evil.

## What is Morality?

Morality is simply:

> The quality of being in (or not in) accord with a standard of behavior, and involves both opposite standards (good & bad) as well as accountability, as in who decides what is good and bad.

A term that goes along with morality is ethics, which is basically a set of guidelines that help determine the “moral” approaches to different situations.

So, looking around us, how do we explain the existence of morality, good, and evil? How do we explain the actions of Professor Librescu, the Holocaust survivor that sacrificed himself for his students in the Virginia Tech shooting? How do we explain the actions of Mao Zedong, who is responsible for over 70 million deaths?

Let's reflect back on the two fundamental explanations of origins that we covered last week.

### Morality in an Impersonal Creation

How is morality handled in an impersonal universe? Put yourself in the shoes of someone who holds this view (even though we have seen that it's not capable of explaining existence adequately).

In an impersonal worldview, morality does not actually exist because there is no actual standard against which behavior can be measured. If anything, moral behavior is seen as a social construct that takes cues from evolutionary instincts.

#### An Example

For example, take a look at this photo of a *Cebus Capucinus* monkey.

This monkey has been observed to demonstrate “good” behavior when in certain situations. When two monkeys are placed in a way that they cannot see each other, but a third monkey can see both of them, and one of the two “observed” monkeys is fed well, while the other is fed scraps, the observer monkey will give extra food given to it to the poorly fed monkey.

This is viewed as “good” behavior from a non-human creature, which then shows that our “good” behavior is simply more highly evolved, not imparted from God or another personal source.

#### Problems

First, it assumes that the monkey doing this is desirable as opposed to keeping the food for itself. Most interestingly, the monkey's actions violate the mantra of survival of the fittest we hear so often in discussions about origins and evolution. We could of course speculate that helping another individual survive is beneficial to you in many situations, but we have no way to determine if that is the motivation here.

Also, we should consider that the monkey only was observed to do this when it was given extra food. In other words it wasn't starving in order to feed the other monkey. It would be more conclusive to observe a monkey voluntarily suffering in order to help another.

We must also consider additional questions. How did we decide that the one monkey giving up food is good? Aren't we defining the action based on our own experience and/or preferences?

Also, should humans emulate animal behaviors? If we are not innately moral, and we are indeed more highly evolved, why would we choose the emulate the behaviors of a lower animal? Shouldn't the behaviors that placed us at the top of the food chain be emulated by lower creatures?

Those with an impersonal, naturalistic worldview must reconcile each behavior against the “gold standard” of survival while denying actual right and wrong. Those with an impersonal, pantheistic worldview must reconcile human behavior with the futility of existence and the lack of moral standards.

Even if you were willing to accept that some actions were better - a tenuous word at best, considering the lack of a standard metric - than others, how could you enforce those expectations on someone else? You may sense that this worldview eventually declines into what's known as Postmodernism, which we'll cover later in the class.

### Morality in a Personal Creation

So how do you deal with the apparent existence of morality in a personal worldview?
There's an immediate explanation in the fact that we're not only responsible to a personal creator, but we're also made in His image, meaning that He's implanted His personality in us to a limited degree.

A personal worldview can not only accept right and wrong - something which an impersonal worldview struggles with - but also responsibility. Responsibility is - or logically should be - an irrelevant concept to a naturalist or pantheist, because you're only concerned about your survival. Any idea of responsibility or accountability simply stems from needing to work with someone who has the power to kill you to avoid that fate.

## The Problem of Evil

You might be wondering what the significance of this picture is.

These are the hands of Adolf Eichmann. Adolf grew up in a single-parent home since his mother passed away when he was 8 years old. He worked as a mechanic, was active in politics, was married with four sons, and served in the military.

While in the military he worked on a plan to assist the Jews in emigrating to Palestine, although the plan was shot down by the British.

Later, in WWII he was assigned with the task of transporting all Jews in German Europe to extermination camps. [He was responsible](http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/orgs/german/einsatzgruppen/esg/trials/profiles/confession.html) for the deaths of millions of Jews. So could you have known that from those hands? They look an awful lot like yours.

What if you had seen his face? Would you be able to detect evil in it? More importantly, how did someone do something this evil when he was created by a good, loving Creator? Not only that, but he was created in God's image. Just like 

Why do some people do good while others do evil?

Evil isn't simply a question of “Who” or “Where” but something we have to confront internally as well. But on top of that we have to confront the question of how God is involved in this.

### Evil as it Relates to Origins

How does evil fit into the explanation of origins?

We are more than willing to jump up and tout morality as proof of God's existence, but are we willing to tackle the problem of evil, which comes as part of morality? We're presented with a paradox: without a personal creator, we have no means of identifying evil as evil, but since we have a personal creator, how do we reconcile evil with His existence?

How can an omnipotent God who is also loving allow evil to exist?

The problem of evil is intellectually the *most* difficult question we will face. It's also the only question that so directly challenges the existence of a loving, personal God. How many times have you heard someone bitterly ask how God could allow something so bad to happen?

This is the only question that seriously challenged my belief in God and His goodness. As a child I was confronted with the death of an unborn sibling, and my response was immediately to question the goodness of God. Although I wasn't denying His existence, the idea of a malevolent, evil god is in some ways far more devastating than no god at all.

How could a God that loved me take away something that I loved? Simply saying that it was His right as Creator wouldn't have helped me, because that does nothing to prove His goodness. That's like saying that I have the right to shoot the family dog because I own it. If we believers are tempted by this question, you should expect that it will be the most powerful, most used weapon in the atheist's arsenal.

As believers, we're accustomed to taking some things, like the Trinity and the hypostatic union of Christ on faith. As G.K. Chesterton said:

> A Christian accepts a little bit of mystery and he can make sense of the whole world; the atheist accepts no mystery and he can make sense of nothing.

But this question is so penetrating that it would be wise for us not to simply cease investigating an apparent mystery and “just trust.” There are some questions that we must answer, even if they make us think!

### A Theodicy

Augustine, a famous early Christian philosopher, posed a theodicy, or a justification of God's actions. Of course God is not bound to justify His actions to us, but Augustine is doing so for the sake of someone raising questions about evil.

He proposes that a runaway horse is better than a stone because even though it refuses to comply, it is *more excellent* than something that has no will to obey or disobey.

### A Defense

Plantinga is the most widely recognized thinker on the problem of evil and is a professor at Notre Dame. His answer is a defense, which basically is designed to prove that God is not violating logic or His own character.

He argues basically that God's goodness and omnipotence do not directly contradict the existence of evil, and instead proposes that arguments based this way assume two things: that an all-powerful God would create any world that He desires, and that since He is good, He would desire a world without evil.

Of course, we realize that God could have created us in a way that would prevent us from disobeying, but who is to say that He would prefer that? As Augustine pointed out, along with the possibility for disobedience comes the possibility for freely given love. Just because you would prefer a horse to a stone doesn't mean you condone evil. It is illogical to say that God must condone evil because He created a world in which it was possible. And which is better, a world where disobedience is possible, or one where you have no choice? His restraint of His ability to eradicate evil is consistent with His righteous desire that sin have consequences. Choosing not to play a game does not mean you aren't capable.

### Limiting God

Remember also that subjecting God to our demands limits (in our minds) His ability to meet them. As Job realizes at the end of the book of Job, God's omnipotence isn't at our beck and call. Christ could have called down legions of angels at the cross, but chose not to in order to execute something even more powerful, the redemption of believers from sin.

Not only does our worldview allow for the existence of evil (God is all-powerful, yet deals out that power on His own terms) but other worldviews are unable to define the concept of evil at all because they lack a foundation for such an idea.

### Conclusions

We aren't forced to explain how man can be good and yet so evil, but naturalists, post-modernists, and other are. We realize that man is broken, and was not created or forced to be that way. Acknowledging evil in the first place requires that you acknowledge the existence of God. As effective apologists, we must emphasize that we only know what evil is *because* there is a God! Evil does not preclude a God.

We have a motivation for fighting evil, unlike pantheists or atheists since we can measure actions against a constant standard. For instance, what motivation would an atheist have had in stopping the extermination of the Jewish people in WWII? Wouldn't the effectiveness of the Third Reich simply be an indication that they are more deserving of survival?

And far from promoting or engaging in evil behavior, God chose to personally identify with the consequences of evil, and in doing so shows not only His consistency, but also His goodness. He knows what evil is like but made something greater out of it. We cannot assume - and in fact we know this is not the case - that God's greatest desire is for a world without evil.

Reflect on Revelation 4:11:

> Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

God did not create the universe to your specifications. He created them to his. John Piper puts it excellently when he says:

> God has chosen to go public with His glory in the creation of the universe. So, it seems to me that fundamental to our motives should be God's motives, and that's the display of God. Ultimately it comes right back to God's purpose for life in his universe.

So when we question the goodness of God in allowing evil, we must couch that in the realization that he personally came and died for us in order to make it possible for us to be right with him. He personally conquered evil on the cross, would an evil god do that?
