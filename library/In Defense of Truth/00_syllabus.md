# In Defense of Truth

*In Defense of Truth* is a class focused on apologetics, which is the defense of a position - in this case the Christian faith - and is intended to help you better understand what you believe and equip you to articulate that. We will also study other beliefs to help you understand their position, as well as why - according to scripture - they are incorrect.
