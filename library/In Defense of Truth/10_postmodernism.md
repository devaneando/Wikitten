## In No Time at All

I gave you a handout to review last week regarding Humphreys’ theory of creation, and I’d like to try and answer questions you might have before we move on.

## Evolution

Last week we discussed the debates surrounding cosmology and time, but let’s look at one of the most prevalent theories about getting from the beginning to the present: evolution. Evolution as a theory existed before Darwin, but he is – for better or worse – the name that everyone associates with the theory. He considered his theory as a possible explanation for the changes we see in biological forms around us - such as birds with varying beaks within species or changes in other species located elsewhere - based on natural selection, which is also known as survival of the fittest. Evolution was proposed as a theory relating only to biological development, but was soon applied to fields such as psychology, sociology, religion, and politics.

Much of what we associate with evolution today isn’t strictly Darwinian evolution. The question we need to ask at this point, after well over a century of unquestioned authority in scientific circles, is whether evolution as a theory is in trouble. Something that is becoming increasingly clear over time is that since it expanded past a strictly biological theory, the consequences have been disastrous. Entire worldviews have been shaped from it, such as Nietzscheism and Freudianism. Marxism holds to the perfectibility of man, while capitalism embraces survival of the fittest. Nazism saw the possibility of a perfect race through evolution, as well as the need to eliminate others that stood in the way. Many believers also caved to the evolutionary worldview and tried to create stop-gap solutions such as theistic evolution, intelligent design, and others.

Now people are becoming increasingly skeptical both of evolution as a worldview, and as a biological theory. Since the rise of relativistic thinking and post-modernism, there is less interest in origins and even less consensus. The intelligent-design movement, misguided as it may be, has raised serious questions that have to be answered, and we’ll cover those soon.

### Questions for Evolutionists

Questions are being raised on many fronts. Several books have been published that raise serious issues with evolution, both on logical and scientific planes.

Philip E. Johnson, known as the father of the Intelligent Design movement, published the book *Darwin on Trial*. Michael Denton published the book *Evolution: A Theory in Crisis*, but it would be greatly unwise to think of him as “on our side." Michael Behe, a Catholic professor at Lehigh University, published the book *Darwin’s Black Box* among other articles, and defended the use of creationist textbooks in high schools.

The fossil record presents a number of problems, including the lack of transitional forms, as well as fossils that mess up the time-scale by either being placed “incorrectly” or by crossing multiple sediment layers.

The Intelligent Design movement has gained more and more steam over the years; basically it takes deity out of the creationist arguments, and limits the discussion to the possibility of an intelligent designer, whoever that may be and however they chose to design. It tends to be a modern version of theistic evolution, which argued that God used evolution to design life. However, it does propose many interesting arguments and questions for evolutionists to answer, such as how mechanisms like the heart, the eye, and pizioelectric cells in your bones developed.

### Conclusions About Evolution

Evolution as a theory is not nearly as complete or foolproof as you might think, although it is really a secondary debate to the age of the earth and the universe. Although a finite universe with a distinct origin in time seems most logical, we must still wrestle with things like starlight. We have to look at scripture in the context it was presented, and it seems clear that Creation happened in six days as a direct act of God, no matter how long these days were, which presents great challenges to the theistic evolution camp.

We have already determined that a personal creator is the most reasonable explanation for the universe, and it is also reasonable to assume that he created the universe as he described in the Bible, after all, what reason would he have to lie? We must not fall prey to the argument that since we cannot explain everything, we can't explain anything. However, we can explain *more* than anyone else, and accept a broader range of sources as we saw in our study on epistemology.

As I've noted previously, these ideas stem from very basic presuppositions that most of us take for granted. Once we analyze them, we often are then forced to analyze and discard other ideas that are incompatible with those presuppositions, so remember to walk people through their presuppositions before tackling them with statistics, facts, and arguments about things further down the chain.

## Postmodernism

The last idea I’d like to cover with our remaining time is that of Postmodernism. Postmodernism is an idea that’s become more and more prevalent over the past two decades, that true, objective knowledge is impossible. It spawned in the discovery of relativity in physics, which showed that time and space can change based on the position of the observer. Like many scientific theories, it rapidly spilled over into philosophy, and led to the proposal that “truth” depends on the observer, and can’t be defined objectively. Thus, what might be *right* or *true* for you might not be the same for me.

Consider [the following](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2000/november13/8.76.html):

> Second, this attention to the marginalized has led many postmodernists into a profound skepticism toward modernity's assumptions about knowledge, truth, and reason. These postmoderns question the extent to which modernity's attempts to make truth claims is valid. They've discovered that at the base of almost every truth claim is a story, a story that privileges certain groups and marginalizes others. Jean Lyotard, the French champion of many postmodern themes, said that postmodernism requires a suspicion of the overarching stories (often called "metanarratives") that support our claims of truth. Any claim to know truth or any attempt to commend truth to others is likely to be just a power play, they argue, an attempt to impose one's own metanarrative in the guise of an absolute truth.

Postmodernism approaches all truth claims skeptically, and with the assumption that they’re simply a means for you to control them.

### How Does This Affect You?

When you approach a postmodernist with the Gospel, they are assuming that you simply want to impose your morality, philosophy, and lifestyle on them. What we need to realize is that we definitely do want them to hear and act upon what they hear, but that we’re not trying to make them like us. When I approach people with the Gospel, my goal is to present God’s plan for them to be made right with Him. Someone in a relationship with Christ, walking with him and being conformed to his image, will change through the power of the Holy Spirit, not through my prodding and nagging.

A “true” postmodernist can be incredibly hard to communicate with because they tend to evade your reasoning, questioning whether reasoning is a valid way to know anything. At that point it may be profitable to put yourself in the position of learning more about their worldview through questioning, which will often lend you opportunities to both critique and challenge their thinking.

You must confront the idea that we’re unable to truly know. For instance, the statement that no one can truly possess absolute knowledge is an absolute statement. True postmodernism is untenable because it assumes common ground is impossible. Even basic communication would be a confusing mess if we each held a private interpretation of language without any commonality. One thing you can propose is that the conversation between the two of you would be impossible if it weren't for absolutes and conventions of thinking.

You’ll also have to challenge the idea that Christianity is right for some people and not others with Christ’s claim that he’s the only way to God. Christianity, and most other religions, do not claim to be compatible with each other, so how can they all be right? If they are indeed compatible, then they are full of lies, making them worthless.

Mostly though, I think you’ll discover that the average “street” postmodernist just doesn't really care. They’re not into postmodernism in the deeper, borderline-insane quest to disprove all truth claims, they’re into postmodernism “light” where you don’t have to worry about whether you’re right or wrong, because no one can know for sure anyway, so just live how you like. Apathy is a powerful defense in a world where everyone’s trying to convert you, and now it’s not called apathy, it’s called postmodernism, which sounds much nicer!

Many times with these individuals, you have to confront their libertarian attitudes toward morality and philosophy with questions about law, crime, and justice. Who are they responsible to for their actions? Would they apply that standard to you as well? Emphasize that society cannot function with a postmodern mindset because certain standards have to be set in order for people to live and work together.

## Conclusions

Postmodernism is dangerous in the sense that it allows the holder the freedom to justify his own actions as well as to ignore the consequences enforced by others. No one can tell him what to do, and he doesn't have to worry about confronting anyone else's lifestyle. We understand from the Bible that there is right and wrong, that there are standards and a higher power to which we are ultimately responsible, and we need to make sure to communicate this effectively in an increasingly postmodern society.
