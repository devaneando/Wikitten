# Relationships & The Nature Of God

**Central Point & Application**

Central Point: Because God himself is a community, he created and intends for us to live in community so that we may be a reflection of him.

Personal Application: I need to be properly involved in relationships.

Relational Application: I need to be in a close relationship to God because my relationships with others will be satisfying only if I am in relationship with God.

## The Big Question

Do you see and treat relationships as God intends for you to?

### Opening Activity (5 minutes)

*Take 3 minutes to brainstorm any words that come to mind when you hear the word relationships.*

Relationships can be messy, and having to deal with flawed people in a broken world can make one wonder if they're even worth it. Have you felt this way? Have you avoided a coworker or neighbor or just swallowed how you feel because it doesn't seem like it would be worth it to open up to them about how you really feel?

Because relationships are so challenging, it can lead to families sharing the same space without sharing any meaningful contact, church without sharing in the lives of others, and neighbors living next to each other for years without knowing anything significant about each other.

Is this a valid way to live? Is it OK to keep to ourselves to avoid hurting or being hurt?

We can live with a tension between our desire for meaningful relationships and self-preservation. We can avoid the pitfalls many relationships bring while still realizing that we are less than human when alone. Every relational decision we make moves us toward isolation or immersion, and sometimes we will find ourselves at an extreme of this continuum. The temptation is either to make more or less of relationships than God intended.

### Isolation vs. Immersion (10 minutes)

"I want to be safe" (isolation) <   <   >   >   (immersion) "I need you in order to live"

*Take 10 minutes to discuss which end of the continuum you tend to move toward and why.*

### Relational Profiles (10 minutes)

Because we tend toward immersion or isolation, our relationships tend to fit one of these three profiles:

**The Frustrated Relationship:** In this relationship, one person moves toward isolation and the other moves toward immersion. One dreams of being safe; the other dreams of being close and intimate.

*How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

The one who seeks isolation may just want to sit and read, while the one seeking immersion may want lots of activities to do together.

*How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

The isolationist can feel smothered while the immersionist feels rejected. Because both feel like their expectations are unmet, they both feel frustrated and disappointed, which may eventually lead to anger between them.

**The Enmeshed Relationship:** Here both people move toward immersion. Both parties are equally dependent on the other.

*How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

They might spend every moment together, to the neglect of all other relationships.

Alternatively, they may spend all their time with others because they crave relationships so much.

*How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

Because they depend so much on each other, they can be easily hurt when the other does not meet their expectation, which can lead them to be highly critical of the other. They can feel discouraged because no matter how hard they try they can never measure up to the other person's expectations. This kind of relationship is exhausting because much energy is spent dealing with minor offenses.

They may also exhaust their relationship spending too much time with other people, or cause offense when they do try to take time alone because the other craves outside attention.

**The Isolated Relationship:** In this relationship both persons tend toward isolation. Both make relational decisions based on maintaining safety.

*How would the perfect vacation look to each of the two people in this relationship?*

They might enjoy spending the time alone, reading different books.

*How might it feel to live in this type of relationship?*

Because they desire safety but also connection - because we are designed to desire both - the relationship feels empty and disappointing.

### Our Communal God (20 minutes)

Since we are made in the image of God, we cannot talk about the nature of human relationships without first thinking about the nature of God.

**John 17:20-26**

> Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.

> And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.

> Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.

> O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.

> And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.

*For whom and for what is Jesus praying in this part of his prayer?*

He is praying for all who will believe in him, and he prays for their unity - that they would be one. It is relevant that as Jesus looks back on his public ministry and all it was meant to accomplish, and looks forward to the cross and all it was ordained to produce, his focus is riveted on community! Of all the things Christ could pray for at this moment, he prays for the unity of his people.

*What is the model for community Jesus sees for his people?*

Jesus want us to have the same community with God and with others that he has with the Father and Spirit. We can see this community also in Genesis 1:26, where God speaks in the plural. God knows how to help us in our struggles with community because he *is* a community. We tend to think of God as an individual; but, while God is one, the Bible also says he exists in three persons: the trinity. God himself is a model of loving, cooperative, unified community where diversity is an asset, not a liability.

*If God himself is a community, what does it mean to be human, made in God's likeness?*

It means we were created to be in community; we were created as social beings. In Genesis 2:18 as God looks at his creation before the fall, he says "It is not good for man to be alone." Community with one another is not only a duty; it is an aspect of our humanity.

*In Christ's prayer, what is one of the purposes for human community?*

Human community is to be a means of reflecting God's glory to the world, that the world may believe in God the Father and God the Son. Furthermore, God has a propose for our relationships; therefore, our relationships must be shaped by what God intends and not by what we want.

*Why do we need Christ to be praying for us?*

Because we are flawed; we are sinners; we can't manufacture true community on our own. Sin's self-centeredness cuts us off from God and others.

*Christ not only prays for our unity with one another but that we would also have community with whom?*

Jesus prays that we would have community with God. We are invited to be a part of this divine community! And it is out of this community that we can experience community with one another. In fact, we can't move toward community with one another until we have been drawn into community with God.

*Is there anything else about this prayer and its background that shows God's deep commitment to creating true community?*

1. It's possible that Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit as the glory he has given us. If so, i means God has given us a way, in spite of the ongoing presence of sin, to be empowered to have meaningful relationships. The Spirit who allowed Christ to minister in a fallen world is the same Spirit who dwells within us to allow us to minister in a fallen world.
2. Christ is facing death on a cross so that our relationship to God can be restored and so that our relationships with others can be glorifying to him.

*Think about the stages of a person's life beginning from birth. What can you identify that shows we were designed to be in community with others?*

* We are dependent on someone else from the moment we are born
* We seek out human relationships
* As teens we seek the acceptance of our peers
* As young adults we seek deeper, more committed relationships
* We have a web of communities we function in: church, neighborhood, schools, family, work
* Our fondest memories and deepest hurts often involve relationships
* We grieve at the loss of a loved one, even when we know they are with the Lord

### Closing Activity (10 minutes)

Look at the list of words we brainstormed for the opening activity; identify any words that should be the focus of our thoughts about relationships.

*Are there any words you feel should be added?*

*Are there any relationships in your life, including perhaps your relationship with God, you need to correct your perspective on?*

God designed us to be relational - it is our very nature, and it is one way in which we reflect the image of God. And *only* when we live in community do we fully reflect the likeness of God. Relationships are not optional! Because of sin, relationships can be messy, but they are not optional.

Problems in relationships are often rooted in our selfish desires - when we seek to fulfill our own perceived wants and needs instead of seeking to please God. If there are problems in your relationships, the solution starts with God; the circle of human community is only healthy when it exists within the larger circle of community with God.

**Central Point & Application**
