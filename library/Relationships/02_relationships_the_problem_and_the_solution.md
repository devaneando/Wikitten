# Relationships: The Problem & the Solution

## Review (5 minutes)

*How important are relationships to God?*

*From where does true community grow?*

*Did you work on any relationships this past week?*

## Central Point & Application

**Central Point:** Our problems in relationships have everything to do with sin inside us, and our potential to overcome the problems has everything to do with Christ.

**Personal Application:** I need to look inward to my heart to identify my part of a conflict.

**Relational Application:** I need to seek restoration in a godly way that includes searching my own heart and confessing my sin to the other person.

## The Big Question

*Where do the problems in relationships lie, and can they be repaired?*

## Opening Activity (5 minutes)

Let's answer the questions on the front page of our handouts. This should take only a few minutes, and if you are stuck answering one just come back to it when you've finished the rest.

Even in our best relationships we can probably answer yes to all of these questions. Even in the best relationship there are struggles and arguments, temptations and conflicts. If we can answer yes to most of these questions for our *best* relationship, how much more work must be required in relationships that are more difficult! Our experiences with relationships help us understand why the Bible includes so many commands and exhortations to be patient, kind, forgiving, compassionate, gentle, and humble. The Bible assumes that relationships this side of eternity will be messy and require lots of work.

## Inside Out, Upside Down

James asks what causes problems among us and answers by reminding us that our real problem is not located outside ourselves (which is the answer most of us are looking for) but rather inside us. In James 4:1 we see that the source is inside us. We allow our selfish desires to rule over us instead of God, and this leads to problems, conflicts, and disappointments. This role reversal - making ourselves ultimate and God secondary - is what the Bible calls sin.

### Exploring the Problem (10 minutes)

Finish each of the lines in your notes with a word or phrase:

*Sin inside of me is like a...*

*Sin inside of me makes me feel like a...*

*When I think of my sin, I feel...*

*When I think of my sin, I need...*

*Would anyone like to share or elaborate on their answers?*

Let's read Romans 7:21-25 and look more deeply into the issue.

*Identify some words or phrases that Paul uses to describe his sinful condition*

* Law: it is something we will never escape in this life.
* War: it's a continual internal battle between our flesh and righteousness.
* Prison: we want to do right, but our sin often pulls against us and takes away our freedom.
* Rescue: our sin requires outside help.
* Death: sin brings death and separation both physically and relationally.

We can conclude from this passage that our biggest problem is inside us, and we can't repair it alone. 

## The Basic Effects of Sin (25 Minutes)

> Kristin and Shane had been friends through grade school, and in high school it began to turn into something more. Although they ended up going to different colleges, they remained close and spent at least three weekends a month together.

> It wasn't long before they began to talk about marriage. They felt so fortunate to marry someone who had been a friend since childhood! They looked forward to spending the rest of their lives together.

> Shane and Kristin found good jobs and were able to purchase a beautiful home in a neighborhood they loved. Their days were busy, but their evenings together were wonderful. They always looked forward to their Saturday date at the local cafe down the street. It  seemed as if they were living their dream when, unexpectedly, Kristin was pregnant. This was not part of the plan. She had tried to be careful, and now she was wondering how to tell Shane.

> She dreaded seeing Shane and having to answer the question she knew he would ask. She wanted him to be understanding, and maybe even excited, but she knew this was unlikely. That conversation became a turning point in their relationship. Shane was outraged that Kristin "hadn't been more careful" and Kristin was crushed that Shane would blame her and treat the baby like a disease. On top of this, they desperately needed her income, but if the morning sickness continued they both knew she wouldn't be able to keep up working much longer. Shane was discouraged, Kristin was sick, and their finances were growing tighter every day.

> The struggles soon began to erode their relationship. Shane became bitter, frustrated, critical, and demanding. He worked more at the office and seemed to be more occupied at home with office matters too. Kristin pulled away and spent more time with her girlfriends. Having been raised in a well-managed, financially stable family, Shane was irritated that they had gotten themselves into such a tight spot. Kristin was hurt that her closest friend now seemed to be an enemy.

Shane and Kristin's problem is internal - not the pregnancy or the financial difficulties. If they continue to see circumstances as the root of their problem instead of their own sin, then they will continue to struggle in their relationship.

Sin erodes relationships by effecting us in six basic ways. Let's identify these eroding influences in Shane and Kristin, and then in ourselves.

### Self-Centeredness

Since relationships are about being others-centered, the self-centeredness of sin will eventually subvert God's design for our relationships. When we reject God, we create a void that cannot remain empty and will eventually be filled with self.

*Can we identify self-centeredness in Kristin and Shane's relationship?*

When things got tough, they both reverted to thinking about what was best for them instead of focusing on what God was doing through them and in them. Kristin expected Shane to see things her way, and Shane was frustrated that his expectations for their lifestyle would now go unmet.

### Self-rule

When God's wise and loving rule over us is replaced with self-rule, other people become our subjects. They are expected to do our bidding and bow to our control. Because relationships are supposed to be conducted between two people who are equally submitted to God, the quest for self-rule will always cause damage in relationships.

*Can you identify self-rule in Shane and Kristin's difficulty?*

Shane tries to control Kristin with demands and criticism, while Kristin uses isolation to attempt to manipulate Shane.

### Self-sufficiency

When we reject God, we believe the intoxicating but poisonous delusion that we are not dependent. If we don't see that we are dependent upon God, it is unlikely that we will be humbly dependent on others. One of God's principle means of providing for us is through our human relationships.

*How have Shane and Kristin moved toward self-sufficiency?*

They each seek solutions to the problem on their own, instead of relying on each other.

### Self-righteousness

When the holiness of God is not our personal standard of what is true, good, and right, we will always set ourselves up as that standard, leading us to develop an inflated view of ourselves and an overly critical view of others. Godly relationships flourish best between two humble people who acknowledge their weaknesses and sins, as well as their need for grace.

*Can you identify self-righteousness in Kristin and Shane?*

Both seem to blame the other instead of acknowledging the mistakes or decisions that they have made and seeking help from Christ. They have focused on - or created - mistakes by the other in order to preserve a positive self-image.

### Self-satisfaction

When we convince ourselves that satisfaction can be found apart from God, we can move in two different directions. We can try to find satisfaction in material things, which will lead to a disinterest in relationships or using them as a means to get what we want; or we can try to find satisfaction in people, using relationships for our own happiness.

*How have Kristin and Shane turned to self-satisfaction?*

Kristin has replaced Shane with her girlfriends to create what she thinks is a more satisfying relationship, and Shane has sought satisfaction of his desires from his work. Neither is investing in the community that they previously enjoyed so much because it seems more difficult than their self-created solutions.

### Self-taught

When we are our own source of truth and wisdom, we forsake the humble, teachable spirit that is vital to a good relationship. We always take the role of mentor and give the impression that we have little - if anything - to learn from others.

*How do we see this attitude in Shane and Kristin?*

They don't listen to each other's perspectives and they don't make an effort to understand the view of the other.

We said earlier that relationships can be a means of diagnosing our own weaknesses. The chart in your notes summarizes the effects sin has on a person and his relationships. Using this chart, let's take a few minutes to make a diagnosis of our own sinful condition.

Whenever the things we want become more important than God, even when we make relationships more important than God, our relationships suffer. The circle of human relationships was meant only to exist within the larger circle of community with God.

## What About the Bad Things People Do to Me? (5 minutes)

What we've talked about so far may give the impression that our relationships are only harmed by *our* sin. Yet the Bible is full of exhortations to patience, forbearance, compassion, forgiveness, and love; to revoke revenge and anger. This is because God knows we will be sinned against. Like Shane, we are sometimes the victimizers; like Kristin, we are sometimes the victim; sometimes we are both.

Even when we are sinned against, we are still responsible for how we react. We all tend to sin in response to being sinned against, adding trouble on trouble. Can you identify with any of these responses to being sinned against?

* I confess your sins to myself with bitterness: *I can't believe she did that to me!*
* I confess your sins to others with gossip: *Let me tell you what she did to me!*
* I confess your sins to God, seeking vengeance: *God, when are you going to do something to the person that hurt me?*
* I confess your sins to you in anger: *How dare you do that to me!*

The Bible reminds us that even when we are sinned against, ultimately our biggest problem is our own tendency for sin. Even when we have been horribly damaged by others, we must guard our hearts so that we are not sucked into sin's destructive cycle. Being sinned against tempts us to sin, so our need for Christ is as big when we are sinned against as it is when we sin. God does not call us to passivity when we are sinned against, but our response is to be with patience, gentleness, self-control, humility, and forgiveness; not vengeance, bitterness, gossip, or a grudge. Holding the sinner "accountable" in a sinful spirit only perverts the very justice you seek!

Perhaps all this feels overwhelming. Is there any hope for restoration or godly relationships?

*What has God given us to help us navigate relationships in a fallen world?*

His Word, which provides wise principles and promises; his Spirit, who convicts us when we are wrong, empowers us to seek forgiveness, and enables us to show compassion and self-control; his body of believers who can correct and encourage us; baptism, which identifies us a child of God and a member of his body; the Lord's Supper, which reminds us to maintain our unity with God and with other members of his family.

### Two Mistakes

If we feel overwhelmed or have lost hope, we may be making two mistakes.

1. We may be thinking God's grace is supposed to deliver us from problems, when, in reality, God's grace often gives us the ability to persevere in the midst of problems. We desire the grace of relief while God gives us the grace of empowerment.
2. We may be measuring our potential to deal with difficulty by the size and duration of the problems instead of measuring our potential according to the size of God's provisions. Even in the deepest difficulty, we are never without resources and never apart from God's presence.

Our problems have everything to do with sin, and our potential has everything to do with Christ!

Shane and Kristin did find grace for their struggle. They sought help. Listening to the other talk about his or her hurts was very difficult at first. But as they faced their struggle, they also saw something else. They began to see their God, not off in the distance somewhere but right there with them in the difficulty. As they began to trust him, they began to find the courage to trust each other again and continue to move toward each other.
