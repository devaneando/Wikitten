# Relationships: God's Workshop

## Review (5 minutes)

*What is the problem in any relationship?*

*Where does the solution lie?*

## Central Point & Application

*Central Point:* God uses relationships to lead us into growth and sanctification.

*Personal Application:* I need to make God's purpose for relationships my purpose as well.

*Relational Application:* I need to take relationships seriously as a gift from God and work through the issues in relationships in order to grow and become more like Jesus.

**The Big Question:** *In your relationships, whose agenda will you seek, God's or your own?*

## Opening Activity (5 minutes)

The following statements are good and show positive areas in a relationship, but can you identify the underlying agenda in these statements?

* "I am so happy we don't argue like we used to."
* "I just love being with you."
* "It's great to know that I have someone I can trust."
* "Before I met you, I was so lonely."

Each of these statements reflects what the person gets out of the relationship, and each one is ultimately self-centered.

A wealthy celebrity has just given a sizable donation to a worthy cause. During an interview he is asked "What motivated you to make this donation?" At first glance the gift seems to be a generous act of kindness. But the celebrity answers, "When I wake up in the morning, I can look at myself in the mirror and say that I am a good person. And when I go to bed at night, I can feel good about myself." No doubt the donation will benefit others, but the point is that what looks good on the surface doesn't always look that way under closer inspection. What we get out of them can "drive" even our most altruistic moments.

## Two Scriptural Themes (5 minutes)

Two themes about relationships predominate in Scripture:

1. The power of self-interest is still present in the believer. While the control of sin is broken, the sin that remains in us still puts up a real fight. We will never escape the power of self-interest in this life, even in our best relationships. In fact, the more satisfying the relationship, the less conscious you will be of self-interest. The most destructive diseases are the ones that don't show themselves in obvious ways. This is true of spiritual illness as well.
2. God has a bigger agenda for our relationships than we do.

*What is your dream for your relationships?*

In all things, God has a purpose and design. God's purpose and design for relationships is to conform us to the image of Christ! Does this match with your dream?

## Ephesians 4: God's Desire for Our Relationships (25 minutes)

We all have a dream for our relationships; and because our dream is often what we want, in the way we want, and at the time we want, it tends to lead to impatience, vengeance, lying, manipulation, envy, competition, disgust, hostility, or anger. Ephesians 4 shows us what God wants our relationships to be.

**Read Ephesians 4**

Paul urges us to live a life worthy of the calling we have received. Our lives should reflect this calling we have received! Specifically, Paul says it should show up in our relationships in the body of Christ. In other words, you can't take the Gospel seriously and not take your relationships seriously.

As we consider this passage, ask yourself whether this is how you think about your relationships. It may be helpful to use this list to think about one particular relationship.

### A Call to Unity

**Read Ephesians 4:1-6**

> Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

Paul says that we are to maintain - not create - these relationships. If we are Christians, we automatically are in relationship with other Christians. We are united with other believers because we are united with Christ and share the same spirit. Therefore, our relationships are gifts to be managed and taken care of. Gossip, slander, anger, and so on, devalue and harm these gifts. If we are willing to pursue, forgive, and serve, we demonstrate care for these gifts. Is there a relationship you struggle to see as a gift? If so, are you willing to ask God to change your heart and your perspective?

What is it about hard work that can be satisfying? Paul knows that relationships, even among people who have the Spirit, will not be easy. The biblical work ethic for relationships is that it will require work and that the work is worth it when we have God's glory and praise in mind. Many give up when the relationship requires work or when we place ourselves at the center instead of God's calling. When we place ourselves as the purpose of relationships, we often decide the dividend yield is not worth the investment. Is there a relationship you should put more work and effort into?

> With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;

Even before Paul mentions specific actions, he describes four key character qualities that are sometimes the opposite of what drives our relationships.

1. Humility: This quality enables us to see our own sin before we focus on the sin and weakness of another. Do you hold others to a higher standard than you do yourself?
2. Gentleness: A gentle person is not weak, but is someone who uses his strength to empower others. A gentle person can use strength without damaging those he is trying to help. Do people regularly feel bruised in their relationship with you?
3. Patience: This quality places others' needs higher than or at the same level as our own. We don't come with a self-centered agenda.
4. Forbearance: A forbearing person is a person who is humble, gentle, and patient even when provoked. Do you love people with limits that are driven by your own perceived needs or interests? Do others feel as if they must always return a favor to keep you happy with them?

Because we have received grace, we are to give grace to others in our relationships. Often, a structure of law, offense, and punishment governs relationships. For example: I have a set of rules you must abide by, I watch to make sure you follow those rules, and I am justified to mete out some form of punishment if you do not. This is a flagrant contradiction of the gospel! God's grace and favor in our lives should reflect his glory and show in our relationships.

> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.

The basis of our unity is the unity of the Trinity, not our ability to get along. We get along because Father, Son, and Spirit have allowed us to do so.

*Can you give ways in which God is humble, patient, gentle, and forbearing?*

* Christ humbly coming to die on the cross.
* The Father patiently and gently working out our salvation.
* The Holy Spirit forbears by abiding with us even in the face of our sin, convicting and correcting, but never condemning.

### An Appreciation of Diversity

How often do we see diversity as a hindrance to good relationships and God's purposes?

**Read Ephesians 4:7-16**

Because it is grounded in the Trinity, our unity also allows us to celebrate our diversity in the body of Christ. There is one God but three persons. God creates and uses our diversity to accomplish his purpose: our growth in grace. Diversity is not an obstacle but quite a significant means to this end.

> But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.

God has created us with different gifts, different capacities for service, and different levels of maturity. All these differences are there by God's sovereign apportionment. God surrounds us with different people to promote his purpose. Do you tend to get along only with people who are most like you?

> For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:

God wants us to mature, to be built up, and to stop acting like infants. He wants the things that ruled Christ's heart to rule ours as well. Relationships are God's tool for doing this construction. This is where the true value of relationships runs counter to what we normally think. We think things are going well only if we are getting along with others. By God says that is is also when we are not getting along with others that he is accomplishing his purposes! For example, if you quit at the first sign of fatigue when you exercise, you miss the chance to become more fit. Exercise after exhaustion is the most efficient and productive time for physical fitness. This is true of relationships as well. God has designed our relationships to function as both a diagnosis and a cure. When we are frustrated and ready to give up, God is at work revealing places where we have given in to a selfish agenda.

We enter into relationships for personal pleasure, self-actualization, and fun. We want low personal cost and high self-defined returns. But God wants high personal cost and high God-defined returns.

Think of a relationship in your life that has problems because you are two very different people. Are you willing to see those differences as God's design so that you may both be built up in Christ? What may God want to teach you or reveal to you through this relationship.

### Our Struggle and God's Agenda

**Read Ephesians 4:17-32**

Finally, Paul lays out what relationships look like when God's purpose rules. He identifies seven tendencies of the sinful heart that are damaging to relationships, disruptive of God's purpose, and require persistent battling.

1. The tendency toward self-indulgence (vv. 19-24): My behavior in the relationship is driven by what I want and not God's purpose.
2. The tendency toward deceit (v. 25): I will manipulate the truth to get what I want out of the relationship.
3. The tendency toward anger (vv. 26-27): I want to control the relationship by venting my anger or holding it over you to control you.
4. The tendency toward selfishness (v. 28): I want to protect what I have rather than offer it to serve you.
5. The tendency toward unhelpful communication (vv. 29-30): Rather than use my speech to make you feel better and put you in a better position, I speak to make myself feel better and ensure that I am in the top spot.
6. The tendency toward division (v. 31): I give in to the temptation to view you as an adversary rather than a companion in the struggle of relationship.
7. The tendency toward an unforgiving spirit (v. 32): I want to make others pay for their wrongs against me.

Examine the struggles in your relationships.

*Which of the seven tendencies do you find yourself leaning toward most often?*

Ask God to help change you in this area. Share this problem with another *who can help*.

We are all tempted by these tendencies. We are not immune even as believers. But when we realize, by God's grace, that relationships demand hard work, we can become willing to enter the struggle rather than avoid it. We see that this is where God is present and active. We begin to run toward others rather than away and can experience the following:

* How much wiser God's plan is for us than our plan for ourselves (vv. 19-24)
* The life changing power of truthfulness (v. 25)
* The healing benefit of gentleness, patience, and love (vv. 26-27)
* The joy of serving the needs of someone else (v. 28)
* The value of loving and wholesome communication (vv. 29-30)
* The beauty of functional unity in a relationship (v. 31)
* The freedom of practicing forgiveness (v. 32)

## Closing Activity (10 minutes)

> Josh was promised a promotion, but it required moving. He and his wife, Sara, began researching the place they would have to move to. It was a nicer climate with better schools, and with the promotion they could easily afford a bigger house. Josh and Sara decided to take the promotion and moved their family of six.
>
>Once they settled in, they began searching for a good church to join. The first church was small and friendly but had no Sunday school for the children. The second church Sara really liked because its worship was similar to when she was growing up, but Josh did not like it. The third church they visited was big, too big for Sara to ever feel comfortable but Josh loved the worship and the preaching.
>
>After two months of seeking, neither Sara nor Josh could agree on any one new church. Josh was angry with Sara for not being willing to try something new, and Sara was hurt that Josh wouldn't give up trivial needs for the sake of the family. After three months Sara began taking the kids to the closest church while Josh stayed home.

*What is Josh's part in the conflict, and what is Sara's? What needs to occur to resolve the issues?*

* The problems began when they considered the move apart from God's agenda, which would have meant researching churches *before* moving. They needed to place a priority on church relationships as God does.
* Another root of the problem is they are seeking churches based on their own agendas instead of seeking God to lead them to a church where they can be used in relationships.
* They are looking for comfort instead of looking to be used by God.
* They need to search their own hearts and be willing to humble themselves; they need to see God to reveal how they can grow from this situation.

*What then is God's agenda for our relationships?*

God wants to use the struggles of our relationships as a means for our growth and sanctification. Like a rock-climbing wall - it takes work, but the work is satisfying when you see where you began and where you ended up; obstacles are in the way but the obstacles are tools for getting to the top if you use them that way. Likewise, relationships are work but can be quite satisfying as we grow and mature, and our struggles are not obstacles but instruments in God's hands. If you look at your own character, you may find some of your deepest growth has been born out of great stress and trial.

## Central Point

1. God has an agenda for our relationships that is often different from our own agenda.
2. Our relationships are a gift from God.
3. Relationships will require work.
4. Conflict and diversity are God's tools to mold us into his image.
5. God's grace enables us to overcome temptations to sin against another and to show gentleness, patience, humility, and forbearance.

## Personal Application

1. I need to examine what I want from my relationships against what God wants for them.
2. I need to accept that relationships will take work but that they are a gift from God to mold me into his image.
3. By God's grace, I need to battle the sinful tendencies of my heart.

## Relational Application

1. I need to apply God's agenda to my own relationships.
2. I need to move toward relationships even when there is conflict so that God can use it to mold us into his image.
3. By God's grace I need to seek to be humble, gentle, patient, and forbearing in my relationships.
